      Shayne has worked for over 20 years in the industry, first starting as a
      lead designer for a website and marketing firm, and then branching off to
      build his own company in 2006. Since then his role has evolved from
      designer to director, and what was once a one-person sole proprietorship
      is now a corporation that continues to grow.


      Shayne is a firm believer in not just providing quality service to our
      clients, but also working closely with them to find solutions that will
      help them reach their business goals and set them apart as leaders in
      their industries. And if this work can be done on a golf course or over a
      good craft beer, then he’s really happy!

      Co-founder of Graphic Intuitions, Julie worked as an Account Manager in the print and marketing industry for a number of years after graduating with a degree in Communications and Diploma in Public Relations in 2003. In 2007 she joined her husband full time at Graphic Intuitions, and along with managing the day to day affairs of the business, Julie acts as Project Manager for both the web and print division of the company.


      After busy days at work Julie gets to go home to an inquisitive 5 year old daughter, a canine that barely fits through the door, and a husband who thinks golfing in the house is a perfectly acceptable pastime. She’s got her hands full all around – and she wouldn’t have it any other way!

      Currently the Vice President of Marketing and Trailer Division Manager for Flaman Group of Companies, Steve has a wealth of knowledge in the Marketing industry; leading teams and organizations, overseeing marketing/revenue plans, and assisting with operations management. He joined Graphic Intuitions as Managing Director in 2012, providing governance, leadership, and marketing experience that is helping us become a world class agency.


      After taking off his many hats during the workday Steve spends time with his growing family, often outdoors where he enjoys hiking and rock climbing, among other activities. He even made it to the summit of Mount Everest in 2013! Rumor has it he does sleep a few hours each night…but we have yet to find proof of this.

      Nem has been working with our company for many years now and provides a wealth of programming and web development knowledge. He is our head problem solver and is always eager to jump into a project and lend his experience whenever possible. Though nobody is quite sure how to pronounce his full name (I won’t even attempt to spell it), we do know he is smart as a whip and can usually solve any problem we throw at him.

      eager to tackle new projects! Whether it’s a brand new web application or
      legacy code, he treats each project with the utmost care and attention to
      detail, and often works directly with our clients to ensure that we are
      building the best product to meet their needs. When he’s not programming

      smoking, espresso making and chestnut roasting.
