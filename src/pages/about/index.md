      bio: |
        Shayne has worked for over 20 years in the industry, first starting as a lead designer for a website and marketing firm, and then branching off to build his own company in 2006. Since then his role has evolved from designer to director, and what was once a one-person sole proprietorship is now a corporation that continues to grow.
        
        Shayne is a firm believer in not just providing quality service to our clients, but also working closely with them to find solutions that will help them reach their business goals and set them apart as leaders in their industries. And if this work can be done on a golf course or over a good craft beer, then he’s really happy!

        Nick has a strong background in app and web development, and is always eager to tackle new projects! Whether it’s a brand new web application or legacy code, he treats each project with the utmost care and attention to detail, and often works directly with our clients to ensure that we are building the best product to meet their needs. When he’s not programming he spends time with his family, teaching them the fine arts of meat smoking, espresso making and chestnut roasting.
