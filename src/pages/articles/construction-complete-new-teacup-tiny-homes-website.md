Teacup Tiny Homes is a new business located in Southern Alberta with an awesome vision, providing a simplified life and offering the opportunity for financial freedom. Right from day one, in our project initiation meeting, we saw just how passionate Teacup Tiny Homes was about their work. We needed to design a website that encapsulated their passion and let viewers realize the benefits and potential of owning a tiny home. By using [custom web design](https://graphicintuitions.com/services/web-design/) and working with them, we created a small one page tiny home website that can grow as their company grows.

Tiny Home Web Design
--------------------

A tiny home may be small but it still includes all the modern conveniences of a regular house. The web design is of the same philosophy. It may be a single page, but it includes all the pertinent information a potential tiny home buyer would be looking for, including:

*   Gorgeous imagery that conveys the lifestyle freedom of owning a tiny home
*   Information about Teacup Tiny Homes, the company
*   Services available
*   Contact information including an online form

As the Teacup Tiny Homes business grows, so can the website. But just like what they stand for, this simple little website looks pretty darn awesome!

Is your business online? Is your website generating sales? We work together with businesses, whether they are big or "tiny", to produce their own personal plan that allows them to realize their goals.
