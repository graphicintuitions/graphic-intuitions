Have you had trouble with your website or Google Ads not showing? Do you want your business to appear when someone conducts a search online? All businesses wish they could appear first for anything relating to their products and/or services. But if it were easy to do, well, I’d be out of a job. The fact is, it takes work to appear in search results, whether they be organic or paid. Many businesses are willing to pay for ads to appear for instant results, but even if you’re paying for Google Ads, there are often updates needed on your website if you want your ad to appear on the first page. For this reason, organic and paid efforts need to work hand-in-hand to improve your results, and can often lower the cost to run your ads.

For starters, let me backup and explain some of the terminology you often hear marketers talk about.



## Ranking, Results, Organic & Paid Search, What Does it all Mean?

If you’re already familiar with what organic and paid search is, skip to the next section. For those not as familiar with the terminology, a Google Search is the text you type into Google looking for answers. What you see next is the “results” which include Paid and Organic results. Paid results often show first and are those that show the little “ad” banner beside the text. These ads appear using Google Ads where business’s bid on keywords or search terms that are relevant to their business. 

Below the paid ads you will see the organic results. Organic means they are appearing for the search term without paying Google to show their website. In the below example, when I searched for “craftsman drill”, the first result is a paid ad from Amazon. Below that is an organic result for Craftsman’s website. In this example, Craftsman’s search ranking is appearing in the first position, which is a coveted position for many businesses. But what do you do if your website or Google ads are not showing?

## How Do I get My Business to Appear in Google Search Results? Paid or Organic.

### Cater to Google’s Rules of Intent

To get a better understanding of how to get your website to appear in search results, you need to remember that Google is a business. Google needs people to use their search engine so they can sell ad space. So because Google wants people to use their search engine, they need to make search results highly relevant to what someone is searching. For example, if you were to look up “restaurants”, your results will show restaurants close to your location, and not in another country. This is because Google knows your intent. If you were to search for restaurants but only got results for places in another country, you probably wouldn’t use Google anymore and go to another search engine like Bing to see if they could come up with results that are more relevant to you. For this same reason, Google doesn’t want to show your website if it doesn’t believe the content is relevant to what someone is searching. Going a step further, even if you’re paying to appear for a search term, **if you don’t include that term on your website, Google won’t even show your ad**.



### Add Content to Your Website

If you want to appear for a search term, you need to add that search phrase to your website’s content. For example, if you're a plumber, you might want to appear for “hot water tank replacement”. If you don’t include that service information anywhere on your site, you probably won’t appear in the results, because Google has no way of knowing if your website is relevant to the user’s search. What you could do in this case is create a service page letting people know what you do and include those search phrases in your content. You’ll want to remember to provide enough content to be seen as relevant by search engines. If your page has 500 words but you only use the word “hot water tank replacement” once, Google might find another competitor’s website more relevant. Be sure not to “keyword stuff” either, Google can pick up on this. The trick is to place keywords into your content all while sounding natural.



### Implement Search Engine Optimization

Working hand-in-hand with your website content, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) works to further optimize your website to appear in search results. SEO takes a look at your website content, technical aspects of your site, your authority online (links back to your website), and so much more.

### Make Sure Your Website’s Working

It sounds obvious, but there are some key points to keep in mind regarding your website’s performance. If your website is not working optimally, Google may not show your website in organic or paid results. Here are a few things to check:

* How does your website function on smartphones?
* Does your website take a long time to load?
* Does the URL have multiple redirects?
* Does your content match what users are searching?
* Is your website secure and have an [SSL certificate](https://www.graphicintuitions.com/blog/http-website-not-secure-chrome/)?



## How Organic SEO Affects your Google Ads

You may have caught on by now, but if you even want to appear in a Google Ads paid search, your organic and paid efforts need to work together. Using our plumber example, if you’re trying to show up for hot water tank services, and yet don’t include any information on this service, Google is likely wondering why you’re bidding on this keyword and if it’s relevant to users. Google MIGHT still show your ad, but they will make you pay more for it. This prevents people from bidding on terms that are not relevant to their business, and can come in handy if you have competitors who are bidding to appear for your company name or brands. 

A great example of competitor brand name bidding is car companies. When we were looking to upgrade our car a year ago, we searched for car reviews on specific makes and models. Despite searching for a specific vehicle, we still got search results for other vehicle brands. For example, when searching for a Honda Civic, also seeing search results for a Toyota Corolla. This is why many car companies will write blog articles comparing their car with a popular competitor’s. This allows them to compete for their competitor’s search terms, while remaining relevant to the user’s search query. 



## Other Reasons Your Website or Google Ads are not Showing

When it comes to ranking organically or paying for Google ads, there are a lot of moving pieces beyond what was mentioned above. You also need to consider: 

* Your ad copy/text and how it relates to the terms you are bidding on
* Does your ad copy relate with the content on your website? 
* Does your website perform well? 
* What location are your ads set to run? 
* Are your competitors doing something better?
* Do you need to increase your bidding amount?
* Etc.

## Starting the Website and Google Ad Creation Process

### Discovery

We recommend creating a campaign by starting with your end goal and moving backwards in your plans to attain it. We start with a discovery session to understand your business and goals. This helps us to ensure we’re working towards attaining your business goals while maximizing your return on investment. 

### Research

The next step is research. Finding the right keywords to appear for is critical to your success. With some research, you’ll discover how popular the terms are that you’re wanting to appear for to know if it’s worth the effort. You will also see how competitive the search term is. We’ve seen bids on keywords as low as $0.15 and as high as $30 per click. So during the Discovery, it’s important for you to know your profit margins to determine if the cost of ads are worth it. This can determine if other options should be explored. 

### Implementation and A/B Testing

Once goals are in place and research is complete, the work can begin. The findings in the first two steps will determine the tasks to be completed based on your business’ priorities. If you are moving forward with Google Ads, we recommend A/B testing. Often starting with at least two or three versions of the same ad, and seeing which one(s) perform best after a couple weeks. Monitoring and optimizing the ads based on user’s actions is important. And seeing the results can provide insight into current and future marketing initiatives.
