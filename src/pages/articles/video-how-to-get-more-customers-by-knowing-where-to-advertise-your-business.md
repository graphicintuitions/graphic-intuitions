As a business owner, where should you advertise to get more customers? Knowing where to advertise can get you better results and save you money in your marketing campaigns. But in order to determine where to advertise, you need to know where your audience is; which leads to the question, who is my audience? This GI Wonder video will take you through how to determine your target market and using that to figure out where to advertise to them.

Determining Your Target Market
------------------------------

If we ask who your target market is, most people will tell us "well, anyone who needs our product or service". Some might be a bit more specific and say men between the ages of 25-40 in the Winnipeg area who are interested in classic cars. Although that's a great start, we're going to tell you that you need more details than this. Within that demographic, there are a lot of people with very different purchase behaviours and worldviews. One person may have a family and likes tinkering on engines while another is single, career driven and likes to take his car out on the weekends to show off. Both of these people fit within that demographic, but your message to the two men would be very different if you were trying to get their business.

So to determine your target market, demographics are still important, you need to know their age, gender, and location. But take it a step further and get to know your ideal client's characteristics, what drives them, and their purchase behaviour. Are they the type to purchase brand-name products, or are they looking for deals?

Where to Advertise to Your Target Market - Examples
---------------------------------------------------

Once you have your target market profile figured out, you will be able to cater your marketing much more specifically. You may notice that you have more than one target market profile as well, which is great! And now that you know who you're targeting, you can make the decision of which online platform to use. This can be an extensive topic so I'll just leave you with a few examples.

**Advertising on Social Media: Facebook**

So number 1, Facebook - it has 1.18 billion daily active users, that's a lot of potential people to hit, but greater potential to lose money if you just throw advertising dollars into the platform without a specific strategy. Generalizing personal experience with many of our clients, again, this isn't the case for all of them, but I tend to encourage Facebook and social media as a platform to use if your goal is brand awareness. People browsing Facebook aren't looking for something to purchase, they're looking at funny videos and interacting with their friends. By keeping that in mind you can still create a killer strategy, but the sales funnel for social media tends to be longer.

**Know the Platform Demographics: Snapchat**

Number 2, look at the social channels demographics, 78% of SnapChat users are between 18-24, so if you're trying to market to 40 year-olds, I wouldn't recommend that platform.

**Short Sales Funnels: Google AdWords**

Finally, example number 3: If you're looking for a short sales funnel, go for Google Adwords. Advertising there will allow you to choose specific keywords or phrases that you want to appear for. So, for example, someone may search for restaurants near me, and your ad will come up. This platform has a shorter sales funnel because people that are searching already have the INTENT to purchase. Now a warning if you don't know how to set up a campaign properly, you can easily waste a lot of money here as well so I would recommend talking to a digital marketing agency like Graphic Intuitions to implement your campaign.
