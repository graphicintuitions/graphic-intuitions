Omnichannel marketing is the cohesiveness of all your marketing channels and internal systems in order to create a unified customer experience. Having a well constructed omnichannel marketing system allows customers to contact you on every channel and have the same level of customer service. However, this experience should still be customized for the platform they are using. In today's market, customers expect businesses to do this, but many fall very short.

---------------------------------------

The biggest benefit to implementing an omnichannel experience is customer service and experience.

How To Implement Omnichannel Marketing
--------------------------------------

It requires finding systems that integrate together and filtering through the storehouse of information held, not to mention training staff to use these systems. Here are a few things to keep in mind and get started when implementing your strategy.

### Start With Your Base

If your internal systems are a mess, providing an omnichannel experience won't work. Having a CRM is a starting point into fixing this issue. All salespeople and support staff need to be able to have a centralized system with all customer information. Your inventory system plays another large roll in this; particularly finding something with real-time information for customers.

### Make Use Of Your Data

People trust you with their data if it's going to make their lives easier and mean they get more relevant information. ie.

*   The remarketing ads that follow them on Instagram with products they looked at online
*   Abandoned cart emails with a discount
*   Segmented emails based on their interests and past purchases

When your channels are merged together properly, this allows you to hyper-target messages to your audiences and gives your [marketing](https://graphicintuitions.com/services/digital-marketing/) a higher return. Therefore, ensure all of your tracking pixels are working properly.

### Focus on the Customer Experience

When creating your omnichannel marketing strategy, put the customer experience first. How will each of the channels you use help your customers? Is there a disconnect between two of them that would inconvenience your customer, such as making them need to repeat information? Each channel's strategy needs to be customized to work with the audience that uses that channel, but it also needs to tie in strategically to your other channels.
