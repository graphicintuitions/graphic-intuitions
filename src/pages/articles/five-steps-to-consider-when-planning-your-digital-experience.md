Your digital experience has always been the first experience you provide to new customers, even returning customers that require reactivation. With the recent closing of the economy, many brands reviewed their online presence in detail as face to face was no longer an option. Some were shocked at the neglected state of this vital area of their business.

Beyond the current needs, pivoting to a digital-first experience has long been a trend, and it will continue. No matter where you are in this pivot: just starting or a mature online brand, there are recommended steps to go through as you pivot or refresh your digital marketing and online presence. The five steps are as follows:



## 1)Audit your online presence

Conduct an audit on your website, social profiles, review profiles/listings, Google My Business, Bing Places, analytics platforms, and content you have online. Your content could be: blogs, videos, product listings in classified sites, and even third party mentions of your organization. Before you plan what you want to do, you may need to understand where you are.

## 2)Embrace that in many ways, your online strategy is your business strategy

This realization may be a big leap for many traditional organizations. I believe digital evangelists have not helped this switch by making this idea an “instead-of” proposition (digital versus traditional or inbound marketing versus outbound marketing). It isn't. Enhancing your online strategy needs to work seamlessly as part of the overall strategy for your organization. This pivot isn't about converting to an inbound marketing strategy versus an outbound one; it is about optimizing your marketing and sales processes to become all-bound. United, together, enhanced.

## 3)Map out your current sales process

Determine your current state and how to enhance your sales processes with digital marketing and online selling tools. Think about what you need on your website to help with virtual selling. Product Sheets that could be downloaded by a prospect or buyer as an example. Or live online chat to bring the experience of in-store representatives online.

## 4)Design your digital experience and marketing as part of your overall experience

The journey for your new and returning customers starts online and flows through your entire organization. What is that journey? Write down the steps and design the upfront buyer’s journey.

## 5)Create a dedicated review process

To ensure you are meeting your business goals, set a dedicated review process. Many organizations set it and forget it. Your Digital Marketing requires constant tending and needs to be held accountable to ROI.

Lastly, as this is a strategic function, you need to dedicate appropriate resources. If you do not have the internal expertise, find a trusted advisor that can guide you through the process as opposed to taking years to level up your internal capabilities. Either way, be prepared to dedicate an ongoing budget to this function. The need to have effective Digital Marketing and an optimized digital experience is not going away. Best to get started or to revisit where you are currently.
