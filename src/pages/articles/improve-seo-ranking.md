What Is SEO?
------------

There's all this talk about needing SEO services but what is it and why is it needed for your business?

Search engine optimization, or SEO is what search engines such as Google and Bing use to find your website. This is what lets your business show up when someone searches for your business online, and when done well, allows you to show up above your competitors.

Google uses a lot of algorithms and rules to determine which website will rank above the other. By looking at the keywords you are using on your website, the quality of your website, website content, a number of reputable links to your website, and more, Google determines where you will rank in comparison to your competitors.

Why Does SEO Matter?
--------------------

Reputation, brand awareness, increased sales, just to list a few. The easier it is for people to find you online, the more likely they are to purchase from you! If someone does a search for a service that you provide, and your business only appears on page three of Google search, how likely do you think it is that a customer will find you compared to if you appear on page one? Chances are they will look at your competitor's listings that appear before yours.

How To Improve Your SEO Ranking
-------------------------------

Well we can't answer that question in one blog post (well we could but it would be really long!), so we'll touch on one way to improve your SEO ranking. Basically, search engines like Google scour the internet searching for traces of your company. For example, when scanning the internet they may find your website, a Facebook page that you manage, and a few listings in business directories. Once it finds these listings it reviews the information that you have on each of these listings to see if it is consistent with what is on your website. If you have a different phone number on your website compared to your Facebook page, or a different address on your Google My Business account, Google sees the inconsistency and may downgrade your search rankings because they don't see your data as trustworthy. The reverse is also true, if you have a lot of listings with consistent business information, Google will find that and reward you for it!
