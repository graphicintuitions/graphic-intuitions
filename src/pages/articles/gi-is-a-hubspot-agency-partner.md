## Why should you care?

Excellent question. Too many businesses deal with inefficiencies on a regular basis. Manual data entry, managing tools, repetitive tasks, [disconnect between marketing and sales teams](https://www.graphicintuitions.com/blog/marketer-vs-salesperson/), and more. With many discussions with our clients, every business needs a CRM but finding the right one that everyone can agree on, from marketing, to sales, to service is a task most managers avoid like the plague. So we've done the research for you!



## Why HubSpot?

When searching for a CRM, we wanted to find something that could not only solve our internal initiatives but could help our clients too. We would only recommend a tool that we ourselves would stand behind! Because we all need to supercharge our sales engine as our business scales.

 

## Our favourite features!

1. The ability to track the direct return on investment! Follow exactly how a new lead interacted with your brand online from the first contact, to form submission, to becoming a client!
2. Automated processes (yay time saving!)
3. Having one central system to manage sales, marketing, and customer service!
