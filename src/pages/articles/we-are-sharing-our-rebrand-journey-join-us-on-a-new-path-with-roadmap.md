This includes;

1. Strategy
2. Market Research
3. Branding
4. Marketing Plans
5. Inbound Digital Marketing Services
6. Content Creation and Execution
7. Web Design and Development
8. Customer Experience
9. Technology Platform Implementation
10. Consulting and Education

**Essentially a complete offering of services and technology that gives you the best customized solutions every time, to fuel growth and optimization of your business.**



Part of this work included a renaming and rebrand of our business from Graphic Intuitions to Roadmap. Our name served us well for over 15+ years but didn’t reflect the updated service offering we will be providing with Roadmap.



The purpose with our new entity is to discover potential with clients and inspire better business. We do that by fully understanding your business’s challenges, opportunities and customer pain points to then create solutions that drive meaningful change within your organization. From this vision the name Roadmap was created and reflects how we take clients from point A to B.The wordmark was inspired by Canadian road signs and nature. It is a nod to our country of origin and our roots in the outdoors while keeping a sense of organization and structure. The icon, an“R” monogram takes the shape of a road.

We will be putting the finishing touches on our brand and processes over the next month before formally launching into the market this January. As you are part of our trusted and valued client group you are the first to hear about our new brand and will probably be the first to notice the changes over the coming months.



Here is what it means to you;

* January 4 is our official launch date.
* Invoices will come from Roadmap starting in January.
* Previous invoices from Graphic Intuitions will still need to be paid to Graphic Intuitions as Roadmap is a separate legal entity.
* You will still deal with all the same people you have been dealing with, except you will have access to a full suite of services.

We are looking forward to servicing you in the coming months and years! Please don’t hesitate to contact us with any comments or concerns.



Sincerely,



The team at Graphic Intuitions.....soon to be the team at Roadmap
