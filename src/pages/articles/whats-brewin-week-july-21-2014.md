We often have clients ask us what quality of photos they need to provide us for print and web. Often we receive pictures that are too small to be used and the resolution is not very good. Or they are cropped in a way that makes using them difficult. Here are a few suggestions:

* Regardless of the platform the pictures are being used for, whether print or web, it is always best to take photos in the highest resolution possible. We can always scale the picture down on our end.
* Always zoom out a bit and leave some extra space around your subject/object in a shot so that there is room for cropping if need be.
* Good lighting is always important when attempting to take a good picture. Use it to your advantage!
* And, at the end of the day, if you need high quality product shots but don't want to spend the extra money, we really suggest you reconsider. Taking good quality pictures is a skill, and having pictures taken by a pro will help promote your product in the best way possible.
