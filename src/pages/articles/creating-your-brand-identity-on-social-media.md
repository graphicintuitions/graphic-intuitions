Many of us know a person who makes their lives look different on social media. Maybe they present themselves as foodies, or share great travel pictures, making them look like a world class traveler. But in real life, they may not cook or travel all that often - they just give us that impression through their online posts. The reason I bring this up is because you can use this same strategy for your business's branding. Not that you want to create a false brand image, but you can sway how customers see you and what you want to be known for. How do you wish your business to be perceived by customers? Do you want to be seen as trendy? An expert in a specific area? Whatever it is, using a consistent branding strategy can relate a lifestyle with your brand, which in turn can attract your ideal customer.

So do this exercise: go to Instagram and check out a few big brands such as Reebok, Wayfair, and Chapters Indigo. By just looking at the imagery you should be able to tell who their target market is, the lifestyle of that ideal target market, and how the brand correlates with that lifestyle. The sales proposition in these accounts is so subtle there is no need to post "hard-sell" content. Their imagery sells the products.

Creating this branding strategy starts with knowing your target audience and what motivates them. After having this information, you can begin implementing your strategy. When posting we recommend you use professional imagery with a consistent look and feel (use the same filters and fonts) so that your posts are always recognized as your brand - without the need for a logo. Remember to also post consistently. Social media is often viewed multiple times a day by its users, which gives you plenty of opportunities to put your message in front of your customers.

Finally, remember that social media is... well... social. So don't be anti-social! This means you need to be getting notifications when customers interact with you and make sure to respond to them. Whether they leave a comment on your post, [a review](https://graphicintuitions.com/whats-brewin/how-to-respond-to-reviews/) (positive or negative), or message you a question, you need to interact with your audience and respond back. Your interaction with customers plays just as important a role in your branding as the imagery you use. Brand identity includes your customer's entire experience with your business.
