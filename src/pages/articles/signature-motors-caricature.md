Now here is a fun graphic design project. [Signature Motors](https://sigmotor.com/) in Winnipeg wanted something different for the homepage of their new website (which we also just launched BTW so you should check it out!). They envisioned the first thing people see on the site to be their team - the people that will be helping them and working on their vehicles. They wanted to do this in a playful way though - not just a typical photo.

To do this we gathered some details on each of the staff members including quirks, likes/dislikes, and hobbies. Our graphic designer then created characters based on those descriptions. The image was created in vector format so it can be used throughout their marketing materials, at any scale.
