The other day I was thinking to myself, how long do cans of paint stay good for? Having painted the house a few years ago, is this still good to use to do touch ups? I'm sure many others have thought of this question as well, and it got us thinking about the type of content people are looking for.

Now cans of paint may have nothing to do with your business but this digital marketing strategy still works. Look at the questions your business gets asked on a regular basis. The content you write can and should help customers in their pre, and post-purchase decisions. By becoming a knowledge expert in your industry and providing people with the information they're searching for, you become relevant in your customer's lives.

Now being honest, there may be certain things you really want to educate your customers on, but you need to be able to word it in a way that is relevant to them. With any content you're writing, always ask the question "why would my customers care". For an example, the other day I saw an ad on Twitter saying "Do you know the right water pressure to have for your sprinkler?" with an image of a garden sprinkler. To be honest, my first thought was, "why the heck would I care?". I could be wrong, maybe this business gets asked that question a lot and maybe it's just not relevant to me. But, is this REALLY the question their customers are asking? Maybe the question being asked is, "My sprinkler doesn't reach my entire yard, what's the problem?", which leads into your answer regarding the water pressure. But until the question was asked, the customer wasn't concerned about water pressure, and therefore the ad was not relevant. Focus on the questions your customers ask specifically, and cater your content towards that. The content might provide the same answer, but what catches the eyes of your customer is the answer to the question they have, not the one you assume they have.

So the bottom line of what I'm trying to say is to make sure you're providing relevant content. By reviewing what customers are asking you on a regular basis you will gain insight into the information they are looking for, and by providing answers to those questions you will become better known as a leader in your industry.
