As a business owner, are you using your social media accounts as your resume? How about your employees? Many think they can keep their personal social media accounts separate from business. In today's day and age, that is just not the case. If you've ever looked into hiring an employee, I'm sure you did a search on them and found one of their social profiles to look through. Don't think as a business owner that because you don't have a potential boss that you're off the hook. No, your "boss" is your current and potential clients. Plus, there is another way to think about utilizing your personal social profiles to give your business some serious benefit.

Your Social Image
-----------------

To give you an intro, this is the very least you should be doing on your personal social accounts. As an employee at Graphic Intuitions, I can honestly say that I need to maintain somewhat of a professional image on my social media accounts. Not saying I can't post anything personal or funny, but I need to keep in mind that the things I post, clients will see. Throughout the years, I've had clients follow me on Instagram or send me friend requests through Facebook, even while I was a waitress. And I would venture to say 80% of the time when we have a new prospective client, they also check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/company/graphic-intuitions-inc-/). People want to know the people they do business with.

Now if you were to look at my profiles, you would probably see way too many pictures of my dog and glimpses into my personal life. Which is just fine, you are looking at my personal profiles after all, and it's ok to show my interests and personality. But I can tell you some things you wouldn't find and things you should avoid because clients are looking at your profiles as well.

1.  Anything that could strike up an argument
2.  Inappropriate content
3.  Constant, shameless sales pitches. Don't be a spammy Sammy

This should be enough not to leave a bad impression should a client look through your profiles. But there's so much more you could be doing to help build relationships with clients through your social accounts.

How To Utilize Your Personal Social Profiles
--------------------------------------------

So far I've talked about what you shouldn't do, but what SHOULD you do on your social media? Don't just think of your social profiles as your resume, think of it as your personal branding. It is the age of influencer marketing, and why shouldn't you be your own brand advocate?

### Why You Should Be Your Own Influencer

As a business owner, you already are an industry expert with knowledge, thoughts, and opinions to share with others. Now you just need to use it in a strategic way to build relationships and followers.

1.  Build a connection. People are more likely to purchase from a company if they have a relationship and trust them, which can be easier when you take a personal approach.
2.  Create a content strategy. The rule of thumb behind the 80/20 rule is 80% content, 20% sales. If you only post salesy content all the time, you're not going to get followers, you'll lose them. Find content that you can use to relate to your audience and provide them value by sharing your industry knowledge.
3.  Expand your reach. If you want to be found, be sure to be on the right social platforms, [know your target audience](https://graphicintuitions.com/whats-brewin/video-how-to-get-more-customers-by-knowing-where-to-advertise-your-business/), and use relevant hashtags.
4.  Engage with followers. Relationships don't go one way, always be sure to respond to people's comments and messages in a timely manner.

In conclusion, as a business owner, your social accounts should be used for your own personal branding. This creates a great networking opportunity for current clients and potential ones and puts a face to your company.
