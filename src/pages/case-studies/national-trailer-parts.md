  National Trailer Parts has been a long term client that we’ve worked with on
  multiple projects including custom web design, print catalogs, marketing
  campaigns, SEO and more. We’ve gotten them some great results over the years.
  We want to share these stats with you and what we did to achieve this.

        We wanted to really showcase the company and products in an animated
        way, which can often be difficult when using themed or templated sites.
        We created dynamic elements which pop out or move, creating a more
        interactive and exciting experience for users.

        The site also required a password protected online catalogue system for
        their dealers to order products. This not only has to be easy for the
        user to navigate and understand, but also include a Content Management
        System that was easy for National Trailer Parts to maintain. Templated
        platforms such as WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla are often very difficult
        to design with, especially when large or detailed systems are required.
        We were able to shape it how we wanted, without compromising quality and
        ease of use.

    ## The Website Development


    We originally designed and developed the National Trailer Parts website a
    few years ago. At the time the current website was not responsive and was
    ready for an update. After a discovery session with the client to better
    understand their business and goals for the website, we discovered the
    priorities of the website development included making the website
    responsive, providing a better user experience for their customers and
    dealers and an interactive, custom web design

## Digital Marketing

When they were ready, National Trailer Parts came to us to discuss generating more leads on their website. With that goal in mind, we conducted a discovery session with National Trailer Parts, reviewed their analytics data, and created a plan to achieve their goals.

## Tracking ROI

When we start any digital marketing project, we want to be able to track the return on investment for any campaign. When National Trailer Parts began working with us on their digital marketing, they had Google Analytics setup but no website conversion tracking. As we were going to start running ads, we added tracking to the website to determine how many people that visited converted into a lead. This tracking was not only beneficial to track the ads but the conversions on the entire website.

Organic search traffic (Google searches) had the highest conversion rate. So using a little deductive reasoning, increase the traffic source = increase the number of website leads. To do this we implemented search engine optimization (SEO) strategies.

With the tracking we added, we could also see a conversion rate of 13.65% from organic search traffic.

National Trailer Parts sells, you guessed it, trailer parts! Based out of Swift Current, Saskatchewan, they service customers from British Columbia all the way to North Western Ontario, and have been in business since 1992.
