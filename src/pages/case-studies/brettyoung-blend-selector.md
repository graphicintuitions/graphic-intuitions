intro: >-
  When BrettYoung asked us to develop a new tool for their customers we were
  pumped. The Stock Blend Selector was designed with the farmer in mind, helping
  them to easily determine the forage blend that would be best suited for their
  soil type, moisture levels, and management system. Based on the farmer’s input
  it also produces a report estimating the amount of seed required for the
  number of acres farmed.

## The Objective

While the tool’s main purpose was to provide a user-friendly, intuitive online experience for customers and dealers, it also was built with BrettYoung’s business needs in mind. We implemented lead generating calls-to-action that provided users with the information they were seeking, while at the same time collecting important user data for BrettYoung, such as soil types, moisture levels, and preferred component mixes. This information can be difficult to gather, so the information it collects, along with the useful product information it provides to farmers and dealers, will provide a solid return on investment for BrettYoung by giving them valuable data for future marketing purposes. This is the first of a few custom web applications we are developing for BrettYoung.
