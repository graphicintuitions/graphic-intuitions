We are still plugging away at some big projects but got to do a few fun podcasts for a client last week that we'd like to share with you. As we are about to launch our social media services this week, we have a helpful social media tip to get you started. The renovations to our office exterior are almost done, and just when you thought we were done with pumpkins for another year, we had to throw a few more pumpkin beer reviews at you.

## Podcasts

There was a time when you had to plug your iPod to your computer to get your podcasts. Those days are long gone. Now, via apps on your smart phone, you can download your favourite podcasts in seconds.  As a business owner, there are so many benefits to creating podcasts. It's a great way to provide tutorials for your customers, share information and build a dedicated following on social media.

Last week, Danni created two podcasts for the Trailer Division of Flaman Group of Companies. Here is how she did it: Once the client sent us the audio files, Danni used a program called _Audacity_ to edit the content and convert it to the proper format. Then she used a program called _Lavelator_ to adjust the sound. Using _GarageBand_, Danni added music to the beginning and the end of the shows. Once the podcasts were created, she uploaded the files to _Sound Cloud_ and posted a link to the company's blog page.

Take a listen to the final versions of the podcasts, where Flaman Trailers talk to two of their trailer manufacturers about what is new with their product lines:

## Social Media Tip

Here's a quick tip to keep in mind as your build your social media following: _Building a social media audience is about building relationships - it's not just a soapbox to preach about your products and services. Share tips, offer incentives, and utilize social media as a customer service tool to foster relationships with your followers so they will gain your trust first. If they like who you are and what you stand for, they will eventually seek out your products and services._

## The Renovations are Done... Well almost

We thought we'd give you another progress picture to see how far our renovations have come. We are almost ready for the big reveal! Just a few more days of work and it will be complete. Fingers crossed our next _What's Brewin'_ post will showcase the finished look.

## The Last of the Pumpkin Brews

There were a few pumpkin beers lingering about Graphic Intuitions - so we couldn't let them go to waste. Here are some comments on the **[Jumpin Jack Pumpkin Ale by Tree Brewing Company](http://www.treebeer.com/jumpin-jack-pumpkin-ale/)** and **[Pumking by Southern Tier Brewing Company](http://www.stbcbeer.com/seasonals/seasonal-imperial/pumking-beer-page/)**.

## Jumpin Jack Pumpkin Ale by Tree Brewing Company:

_![jumpin jack](/img/jumpin-jack.jpeg)Good flavours, steady combination of IPA and pumpkin ale. Solid hop & spice balance. A little light for what it would seem, but a delicious brew nonetheless. Hopiness makes a definite appearance.
Rating: 7/10_

Loved the fact that they kept the true IPA Flavours. No trying to mask things here with a fake pumpkin taste. Great hops forward flavours followed by a smooth pumpkin finish. Loved it!
Rating: 8.5/10

## Pumking by Southern Tier Brewing Company:

_![pumking](/img/pumking.jpg)Immediate scent of pumpkin pie - dense amber colour.  Pours as you would expect, taste is fairly balanced with some hop bitterness. A little heavy on the dessert side for me, but alas a tasty beverage.
Rating: 6.5/10_

Pumping takes you on quite the flavour journey. You start with a smooth malt flavour, followed by a punch of dark caramel and end off with pumpkin spices on the palate. Don't even think Frodo travelled this far!
Rating: 6.5/10

Have a great week!
