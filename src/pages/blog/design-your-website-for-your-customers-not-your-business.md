When planning a website’s design, there’s one rule of thumb to always abide by first and foremost, how does it help my customer? It sounds pretty straight forward but I can’t count the times we’ve spoken with business owners about the poor user experience on their website that even leaves us confused about how to use the website. So how do you design a website that puts your customers first and converts visitors into leads?



## Leave The Internal Jargon For The Office

It doesn’t matter what you call your internal division, products, etc, if your customer doesn’t know what it is, don’t use the terminology on your website. Your website doesn’t need to fit your internal structure if it doesn’t add to the user experience online. 



## Don’t Bury Your Content

All of your website’s content should be able to be navigable within three clicks. Otherwise, it can really confuse people, making them unsure where to find the content they need and impossible if they ever want to revisit the page if they haven’t bookmarked it. 



Your most important content should also be higher up on the pyramid (fewer clicks in) with appropriate web design implemented to make headers and elements stand out. Plus this allows people who skim through a page to still see the most important information. Because let’s face it, if you land on a website that uses big blobs of text with little formatting, we leave and see if we can find a better resource. 



## Use Relevant Content

The customer is the one you need to impress on your website. What information do they need to make a purchase decision? Again, don’t assume, look back on the information they’ve asked of you and incorporate your answers into your website content. You’re wanting to be helpful, and to do this you need to provide information. Content is king after all. 



When given the opportunity, you can create gated content. This is something of value to customers that they sign up to receive. Giving you their contact information and giving them valuable content. 







By putting your customers first, it greatly increases the odds of someone converting. I’m sure many of us can relate to making a purchase decision based on the usability of a website, so don’t make your business’s website an exception.
