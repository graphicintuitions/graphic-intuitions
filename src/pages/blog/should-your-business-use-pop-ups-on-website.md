It's a bit of a love/hate thing. You've probably heard arguments for and against pop-ups and have your own opinions, but what do your customers want? Is it helpful or intrusive and annoying? As I'm sure you could guess, it depends! There are do's and don'ts to implementing appropriate pop-ups on your website, but first, consider your audience.

Consider Your Audience
----------------------

It's already been proven that [email marketing](https://graphicintuitions.com/whats-brewin/email-marketing-isnt-dead/) is powerful when done correctly. By building up your email list, you open up the possibilities to continue to market to them. This leaves the question, how do I build up my email list? Pop-ups can be a great way to do this when done correctly.

First, consider how people are using your website. Is the goal to make a purchase? Receive information? Determine your customer journey on your website and add a pop-up to complement their journey. For example, if it's a user that has never been on your website before, a pop-up with a discount could be beneficial in their decision making. But timing is key, since it can be extremely annoying to get a pop-up immediately when you get to a site without even seeing what your business has to offer.

Complement The Customer Journey
-------------------------------

Briefly mentioning this in the previous point, timing is everything if you want to improve conversions. There are many ways you can do this, for example, if a user has looked through a few pages and has not completed an action, it might be good to ask them if they're able to find what they're looking for and offer a solution. Or maybe you offer a service and your customer could use help determining what service is best for them with an interactive quiz. Just remember, a pop-up should aid in their purchase decision, not hinder. So stay away from having multiple pop-ups that would overwhelm someone.

Don't Ask For The Farm
----------------------

What information is a person ok with giving up in return for what you're offering? Generally, you want to keep it as short and simple as possible to entice people to signup. This may be something you test to see if a certain field requirement lowers the likelihood of a conversion.

Segment Your Email List
-----------------------

Pop-ups allow you to segment your list straightaways. Instead of pooling all of your subscribers into the same email list, segment them into groups that make sense to your business. Whether that's by gender, interests, location, etc to ensure what you send to that group is highly relevant. The more relevant your message is to someone, the more likely they will be to engage with your content and avoid unsubscribing.

Conclusion
----------

Pop-ups can be great pieces to add to your online marketing strategy. [The average conversion rate for all pop-ups is 3.09%](https://sumo.com/stories/pop-up-statistics). The key is in the implementation. Don't just add it to your website because someone told you to, put thought into the placement and timing so it helps your customer and your business.
