We normally don't like doing personal beer reviews, we prefer to do them as a collective on Friday afternoons, but when the boss tastes one of the best beers ever (again), we have to trump our old procedures. Here is what Shayne had to say about this amazing brew!

![bottle-glass-cujo](/img/bottle-glass-cujo-107x300.png)_Beer and hockey: two quintessential Canadian past times. **[Lake of Bays Brewing Company](http://lakeofbaysbrewing.ca)** understands this all too well and thus setup the NHL Alumni Partnership for their Signature Series beer. I was lucky enough to get my hands on the Cujo (Curtis Joseph) Imperial Golden Ale, which is easily one of the best beers I have had in a long time. To be honest, I can still taste it, that is how good it was. It starts with a sweet, almost honey brown flavour, followed by an amazing apricot finish that balances it all out. Usually when you think honey brown, you think of a heavier weight beer, but this one was as light as a lager yet still came in at 8% alcohol. Gotta say, Lake of Bays, you have seriously out done yourself here. Can hardly wait to get my hands on the rest of the NHL Alumni Signature Series brews!_

Wow, that is some claim, Shayne! It makes it really hard to follow that up with some work-related mumbo jumbo but we'll give it a whirl.

Last week, we hinted that we were setting up a live chat feature for one of our customers. Now that it has officially launched, we can give you a few more details. **[Dakota Micro](http://Dakotamicro.com)** wanted the ability to chat with their customers live on their website to better serve them. Thanks to a third party service, we were able to provide them unlimited monthly conversations with customers, and CRM and help desk integration that essentially takes the customer transcripts and integrates it with their own customer relationship management systems to help them track orders and queries. It's a slick little feature that really gives Dakota Micro better access to their client base.

I'm Natalie Batkis and I have been writing social media content for Team G.I. for the last few months. However, now I will be doing it on a more permanent basis! As Business Development Manager, I will still be providing social media content and other marketing tasks for Graphic Intuitions but I will also be assisting our customers - past, current and future - build upon their marketing strategies. I will be formally introducing myself in the next few weeks but in the meantime, if you want to discuss anything, you can email us at [**info@teamgi.ca**](mailto:info@teamgi.ca). I'd be glad to help!
