<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an ecommerce website opens doors for traditional brick and mortar stores in so many ways. According to Big Commerce, "Ecommerce is growing 23% year-over-year, yet 46% of American small businesses do not have a website". With 80% of Americans shopping online monthly, if you're not online, you could be missing out on a large opportunity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A traditional brick and mortar store has a limited reach, even with advertising, customers are only able or willing to travel so far to visit your store. Having an ecommerce website brings convenience to your customers and allows more people to find you online to make a direct purchase.</span>
