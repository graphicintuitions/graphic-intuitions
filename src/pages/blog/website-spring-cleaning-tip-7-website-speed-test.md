Oh no, too slow? Don't worry here are some suggestions to keep your page load times quick:

**✓ Limit/avoid large videos, photos, flash and other files** - Quality versus Quantity. Tempted to make the website more enticing by adding multiple types of multimedia on a single page? This may cause the page to become slow to load. Think about which image/video best illustrates your message before rushing to integrate another 15 audio/video files.

**✓ Compress to minimize load time** - To speed up your website, best practice is to compress images and use the right file type. Resize images before uploading them. A piece of advice here: Do not resize images using height and width attributes in your code but using Photoshop or another photo editing tool.

**✓ Reduce the number of redirects where possible** - There is a risk that with time some pages become outdated or altered by new versions. As a result, some external links keep pointing to the old pages.

There are many factors that can negatively affect the loading time of your website -  from poor hosting services to technical issues with code - and the biggest speed killer... large image sizes.
