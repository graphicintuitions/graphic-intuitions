ROC & The Fern is an organic orchard located just 45 minutes south of Winnipeg in Lowe Farm and run by Eric & Jodi.

Their passion for people and the land encouraged them to start their orchard and stirred their desire for others to have the opportunity to experience it as well.

ROC & The Fern offers a unique experience in Manitoba, allowing people to totally unplug by visiting the orchard, picking organic fruits and vegetables, and even offers rustic stays in their tiny cottages. These rustic stays focus on simplicity, offering a bed, a firepit area for cooking, and a yoga dock overlooking the pond. Allowing those to unplug and reconnect with a hobby while enjoying the fresh country air.

We know images speak louder than words, so when we had the opportunity to work with ROC & The Fern, we recommended a photo shoot to showcase their orchard and the new rustic stays they are offering. These images can be used on their social media to show people what they offer, as well as on their new website. (Which is currently in the making but we're excited to show you soon!)

We could go on but scroll through the images and see for yourself what ROC & The Fern has to offer!
