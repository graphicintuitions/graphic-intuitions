For the past few weeks, our team at Graphic Intuitions has had the pleasure of working with one of our long time clients, CJay Trailers in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan. A few months back, our graphic design team created a print brochure for the company which highlights the "CJay Difference" along with product specifications and details on options and features. The print piece is ideal for the few customers that may not be online or when you need something tangible to give your clients. Once they saw the results of the brochure, they asked us to build a website following the same design; syncing their print and web design. Each page developed includes custom imagery and content, with a responsive web design that allows for optimal viewing in mobile, tablet and desktop.

[CJay Trailers](http://www.cjaytrailers.com) manufactures general-purpose cargo trailers and specialty trailers such as car haulers, quad trailers, snowmobile trailers, tool trailers and even customized office trailers. The print and web design our team has created for the company fit well with the brand and maintains Cjay Trailer's identity across various marketing platforms.

Brad Harvey, owner of CJay Trailers in Moose Jaw, was thrilled with the results:

"Darn you folks do good work! I'm really impressed with this new site."

"Can't wait to show our dealers the new site"

We always enjoy working with the team at CJay Trailers!
