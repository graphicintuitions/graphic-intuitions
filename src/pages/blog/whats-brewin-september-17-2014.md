We are stepping away from beer this week (I know, shocking) to talk about hot sauce. Not just any hot sauce; the old auntie hot sauce from China.

Last week in our lunchroom, we were asking one of our newest employees about the food from her home country of China. Danni likes spicy food and we wanted to know what her thoughts were on the spicy sauces we have here in Canada and how they compare to the spicy sauces from back home. Danni finds our hot sauces a bit sweeter than her favourite spicy sauce from China. Of course, we all wanted to know what this magical sauce was.

Danni explained that the bottle has the face of a woman on the front and it is called "**Lao Gan Ma Chili Crisp Sauce**". Because this sauce is so cherished in China, they jokingly call it the "most beautiful lady in the world's sauce". Translated, the name means "old auntie" so she's kind of like the Aunt Jemima of the hot sauce world. Danni even made spicy cold noodles on Friday so everyone could try the "old auntie hot sauce". Although I wasn't there to taste this magnificent creation, the boys assured me it was very delicious. You can find this hot sauce in Chinatown or in the Asian food section of your major grocery store chains. Thanks for sharing Danni!

You know what else is heating up? Tradeshow season. That's right, it's that time a year where we want to remind everyone to review your tradeshow booth and marketing materials to make sure they are up-to-date and representing your company the way you want them to.

We also just launched a HOT new site. Well, it's probably not really hot but I'm trying to go with a theme here. It is really cool though!  Especially if you're into seeds. The super rad site we're talking about is for **[Red River Seeds](http://www.redriverseeds.com)**.

Using WordPress as a base for this site, we were able to customize the design to fit the customer's marketing requirements. A few other important features of this site include its responsive design (fancy word for "easy to see on your phone"), and a scrolling section on the homepage that helps customers find what they are looking for more efficiently. The navigation of the site is simple and easy to use while still providing a lot of helpful information to users. Smokin'!

Well now that I've exhausted my "spicy hot" theme, I think I'll call it a day. Can't wait to share more fun and exciting news with you next week. And I'll try to stay away from the "themes".
