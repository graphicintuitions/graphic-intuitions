The bottom line, is your website helping your business achieve its goals? This is a question many business owners don’t have the answers to and are not able to say the return on investment (ROI) they get on their website. To be able to see the ROI on your website as well as having data to make marketing decisions, your website needs to be tracking some key metrics. 

**The Most Important Web Metrics to Track:**

* Conversions
* Traffic Volume & Sources
* Bounce Rate
* Top Pages
* Top Locations
* Device Usage

## Conversions

This one should be obvious to track ROI, but unfortunately, many businesses do not have tracking set up for this. Part of the reason, we believe, is because people just don’t know that you can do this. Tracking can and should be put in place to see how many people are calling, emailing, submitting a form, initiating a chat, or completing a purchase on your website. As each business has its own set of goals and requirements, these are subject to change. But whatever it is that you do, your conversions on your website should always be tracked to then give you a conversion rate. Once you know your close rate, the average sale value, and lifetime customer value, you will be able to create an estimated return on investment for your website.

## Traffic Volume & Sources

The volume and where your website traffic comes from is essential information for your business. I’d venture to say 90% of the time for our clients, organic search traffic holds the most value, generating the highest conversion rate once we add conversion tracking. This then shows us that we need to make it our goal to increase traffic from organic search. 

Proper tracking will also show you campaign data to determine whether it was a success and how it compared to another campaign. In this example below, we can see Direct has the most traffic, however the conversion rate is only at 0.78% where as Organic Search has a conversion rate of 2.51% and a campaign classified as (Other) has a conversion rate of 24.56%. Using this data we can determine where to focus our marketing efforts or where we can improve.

## Bounce Rate

Bounce rate is the percentage of people that leave your website after only visiting one page. Therefore, the traffic sources with the lowest bounce rates can show us who is most interested in what you have to offer. Using the example table above, we see that Organic Search overall has a fantastic bounce rate of 2.9% with the average user visiting 3.87 pages on the website. 

## Top Pages

This shows what people are most interested in on your website and could signal potential issues if your most important page is not one of the top viewed. For example, if your number one goal is for someone to contact you, yet your contact page is not in the top 10 pages, that could signal that people are not ready or willing to contact you and website updates may need to be done. 

## Top Locations

See where your website traffic is coming from. Is the traffic even in your service area? This can show you if your website traffic is relevant or if you should consider serving another location. 

## Device Usage

We like to look at this to see if there are usability issues when people are using a mobile device when viewing a website. If the bounce rate is higher on a mobile device, that can often signal issues that need to be fixed such as page load time.

There is plenty more data you could be tracking but these are the most important web metrics that we track on average. These metrics are key to providing us with data needed to make calculated business decisions that result in growth. With business data at our core, we help businesses with planning and implementation of marketing strategies. Start your 2019 right, contact us to get started.
