Well, it's the last month of the 2014 - and it has been a great year for us! We've moved to a new building, we've gained 3 new staff members, and we've increased the number of services we provide our clients by including social media marketing to the mix. It's nice to reflect on a year and see so much growth and excitement around our business. Thanks for being an important part of our success!

In this month's newsletter, we can finally reveal the new building exterior now that the renos are completely done; we have some great marketing tips to increase your holiday sales; and we are sharing an easy but important pro tip!

## Building Renovations

In our last newsletter, the old building facade was being taken down but we weren't able to show you the finished product because it wasn't completed yet. A month has passed, and we can finally announce that the building exterior is done, minus our sign but that should be up very shortly too. We are very happy with how the building reflects our brand while still staying true to the building's original roots of an old firehouse. Here's what it looks like now!

## 4 Marketing Tips to Increase Your Holiday Sales

It's the most wonderful time of the year, so the song says. Especially for retailers! Over the last few years, there has been a significant shift in how people are shopping. It's not your grandma's shopping experience anymore. Eighty-seven percent of holiday purchases are expected to be made via mobile device. Is your digital storefront ready to welcome the droves of consumers wanting to spend? Here are a few tips to make sure you're ready to get the holiday party started.

**1. Decorate your digital store front**

If you were having a holiday party at your house, I'm sure you'd hang up a bit of tinsel, put up the tree, and string a few lights. Otherwise your party would be a big ol' dud. Your online presence has to be ready to greet guests and put them in the holiday spirit. This means sprucing up your website, social media pages and email marketing to include a holiday feel that will make your customers feel warm and fuzzy and ready to spend money. **[Give us a call](https://graphicintuitions.com/get-in-touch/)** so we can add a few touches to your branding to increase your holiday flair. It doesn't usually take too much tinkering to make that happen, but the impact is significant on your ROI.

**2. Increase your email marketing**

A few months before the holiday season, it's a great idea to start sending out more emails to your magical list of clients reminding them of new products and promotions. You'll also want your email marketing to match your social media and web content as well. Make sure your email subject lines are either simple (stating the sale or promotion), or clever (funny or pique the reader's interest). Inboxes are inundated with promotional emails this time of year. Make sure yours stands out.

**3. Consider Free Shipping**

I know personally, as a consumer, the only time I will buy online is if the retailer promises free shipping. Otherwise, I might as well go to the store and pick it up myself. This doesn't mean you have to offer it for two months straight! Try peak shopping times like Black Friday or Boxing Day, especially if you want to compete with the online shopping frenzy.

**4. Is your site responsive?**

If your site isn't mobile-friendly, you've pretty much lost most of the holiday business you could have benefited from. As I mentioned earlier, almost all purchases made this holiday season are predicted to be made online. You really need to see the value in making your site responsive, not just for the holiday season, but in order to keep up with marketing trends.

Even just implementing a few of these techniques can really change how consumers perceive your business this holiday season. Remember, we're always here to help you amp up your marketing presence. **[Contact us](mailto:julie@teamgi.ca)** today!

## A Pro Tip: How To Do a Hard Refresh on your Web Page

Isn't it annoying when you think your design firm has made updates to your website, only to find out the changes haven't been made? Well, here's a little secret. There's a good chance the changes were made but if you haven't done a hard refresh of your website page, old images may get stuck in the browser cache (temporary storage of web documents) and that's why you are still seeing them. In order to do a "hard refresh", you have to _**hold shift and click refresh**_. Voil√†! Now you should be able to see the new updates that were made to your site.

## Happy Holidays!

December is upon us and, with that, comes the end of another year. We are very fortunate to work with such great clients, and value the relationships we've built with all of you over the years; some of you we've only known for a few months, while others have been with us since the beginning. We want to wish you all a wonderful Christmas filled with the warmth of family, health and peace. We look forward to working with you in the new year! Please travel safely and responsibly.
