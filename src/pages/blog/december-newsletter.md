## 4 Marketing Tips to Increase Your Holiday Sales

It's the most wonderful time of the year, so the song says. Especially for retailers! Over the last few years, there has been a significant shift in how people are shopping. It's not your grandma's shopping experience anymore. Eighty-seven percent of holiday purchases are expected to be made via mobile device. Is your digital storefront ready to welcome the droves of consumers wanting to spend? Here are a few tips to make sure you're ready to get the holiday party started.

### **1. Decorate your digital store front**

If you were having a holiday party at your house, I'm sure you'd hang up a bit of tinsel, put up the tree, and string a few lights. Otherwise your party would be a big ol' dud. Your online presence has to be ready to greet guests and put them in the holiday spirit. This means sprucing up your website, social media pages and email marketing to include a holiday feel that will make your customers feel warm and fuzzy and ready to spend money. [Give us a call](https://www.graphicintuitions.com/contact) so we can add a few touches to your branding to increase your holiday flair. It doesn't usually take too much tinkering to make that happen, but the impact can effect your ROI.

### **2. Increase your email marketing**

A few months before the holiday season, it's a great idea to start sending out more emails to your magical list of clients reminding them of new products and promotions. You'll also want your email marketing to match your social media and web content as well. Make sure your [email subject lines](https://www.graphicintuitions.com/blog/create-holiday-experience-shoppers/) are either simple (stating the sale or promotion), or clever (funny or pique the reader's interest). Inboxes are inundated with promotional emails this time of year. Make sure yours stands out.

### **3. Consider Free Shipping**

I know personally, as a consumer, the only time I will buy online is if the retailer promises free shipping. Otherwise, I might as well go to the store and pick it up myself. This doesn't mean you have to offer it for two months straight! Try peak shopping times like Black Friday or Boxing Day, especially if you want to compete with the online shopping frenzy.

### **4. Is your site responsive?**

If your site isn't mobile-friendly, you've pretty much lost most of the holiday business you could have benefited from. As I mentioned earlier, almost all purchases made this holiday season are predicted to be made online. You really need to see the value in making your site responsive, not just for the holiday season, but in order to keep up with marketing trends. And remember, responsive means more than just being able to see the website on mobile, it should be optimized for speed as well.



Even just implementing a few of these techniques can really change how consumers perceive your business this holiday season. Remember, we're always here to help you amp up your marketing presence. **[Contact us](mailto:julie@teamgi.ca)** today!
