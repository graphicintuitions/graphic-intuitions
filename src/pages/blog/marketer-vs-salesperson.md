Businesses can often find themselves in a Clash of the Titans struggle - pitting salespeople against marketers. But while both play different roles within a company, they need to work together to optimize the company's bottom line and provide the highest value to clients. But how do we get these teams to work together? This applies to in-house marketing teams or an external marketing agency.

The Difference Between a Marketer and a Salesperson
---------------------------------------------------

Both positions have different strengths, and when combined together, can create the ultimate experience in the customer journey. Here are a few key differences between the two roles:

### Customer Interaction

Salespeople work closely with customers with 1 on 1 interactions whereas marketers look at audiences as a whole, grouping together people who share similarities. By analyzing your customers as a whole, you are able to pinpoint your ideal client, but when it comes to the sales process, no customer wants to be lumped into this group, they want 1 on 1 interaction with someone who can solve their problem, hence the sales and marketing teams (or marketing agency) should have each other's backs.

### Data vs Relationship Driven

Marketers look at hard data - constantly! To marketers, a customer could be identified as a lead that was brought in from targeting "men in Winnipeg interested in fishing", for example. Whereas a salesperson might know that same lead as, Dave, who has 3 kids and likes to take his kids fishing. The salesperson puts more focus on relationship building and networking, while the marketing team focuses on target audiences and data analysis. Both aspects are important, the salesperson is a huge part of relationship building and networking, while marketers have the resources to pinpoint and target this audience.

### Different Goals

As the name suggests, the main goal of a salesperson is to bring in sales. The marketing team focuses more on improving return on investment for your business, through brand recognition, product testing, tracking, etc. This can create tension between both teams because you can easily see the number of sales a salesperson has brought in, while not all marketing is trackable. But with good communication the two roles can feed off each other, allowing you to increase sales while providing your clients a better service at the same time.  It's only with good communication that you will find out that someone had followed you on social media for a few months and then decided to call you from the website.

Communication is Key
--------------------

Each marketing campaign can have a different goal, whether that's to generate awareness for the company or gain leads to pass along to the sales team. If the sales team does not inform the marketing team on where leads are coming from, it can hinder the value of the campaign and keep both sides from knowing where to spend more effort to grow those leads for the business. And if the marketing team isn't letting the sales team in on their campaign objectives, then the sales team is not aware of what information should be shared.

Like PB & J, marketers and salespeople belong together and are able to build each other up by utilizing each other's skills and experiences. This can be better managed internally by implementing a CRM system that allows everyone to be informed of the day-to-day business activities. Or by having processes in place such as:

*   Weekly meetings
*   Delegating tasks so each person is clear on what they are doing
*   Communicating objective on the sales and marketing aspect
*   Sharing results with one another

The list goes on. Even if you don't have an in-house marketing team, processes can be put in place to work with an external marketing agency.
