Graphic Intuitions closed it doors on Friday, but it's not as dramatic as it sounds. We only closed them for an afternoon so we could get out of the office and bond as a team. No, we didn't hold hands and sing kumbaya; we went to a pub where we ate, enjoyed a few beverages, and played pub Olympics. I'll explain that in a minute.

Two things became apparent quite quickly at our team-building afternoon. First, we are so much cooler when we are not hiding behind our computer monitors. And secondly, we have a very competitive bunch of maniacs working for Team G.I.!

Our destination was **[Winn City Pub](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Winn-City-Pub/115601411804838?fref=ts)** at the Quality Inn on Pembina Highway in Winnipeg. It's a really fun venue where you can test your skills in pool, darts, virtual target practice and virtual golf. You can play the games separately or have two teams compete in an Olympic event where everyone attempts each event and is then awarded points which are added to their team's score. For the record, my team, which consisted of me (Natalie), Julie, Pierre and Chris C., won the Olympics. Shayne, Chris R., Brenley and Danni made up the other team. They gave it their all so we give them points for effort!

Once the Olympics were over, we took turns playing the various stations for fun. The two most popular events were the virtual target practice and virtual golf. Within an hour of taking over the shooting range, Pierre and Julie had wiped the top ten scores off the board in Mallard Mania and dominated the game, until Shayne stepped in and gave them a run for their money. But in the end, Julie proved she was the top contender and untouchable. That being said, she says you will never catch her shooting furry creatures in real life. Mallards: you live to see another day.

Shayne, Chris R. and Pierre also played the longest game of virtual golf ever with Shayne finishing on top. They even took out their own golf clubs for the big event. Hard core!

All and all, it was great to unwind while getting to know each other outside of the work environment. And it's good to know that if the zombie apocalypse does hit, we have a pretty strong bunch of shooters in our midst to protect us. How many marketing companies can add that to their list of services?

And it wouldn't be a "What's Brewin'" post if we didn't talk about beer. A few weeks ago, our crew sampled Demeter's Harvest from Half Pints in Winnipeg which boasts an alcohol content of 11%. Impressive! Here's what we had to say about it:

• Flavourful
• Sweetness at the back of the pallet
• Doesn't taste like 11 percent
• Heavyweight in the bottle - lightweight in the ring
• I could taste the beer
• It mellows out at the end

The rating was 7.2 out of 10. We're giving out decimal points now? This beer rating stuff is getting serious.

Now that our Canadian Thanksgiving is over, we are gearing up for a busy end of the year. We'll have lots to talk about in the next few months so keep checking back. And leave a comment if you like what you see or have some post suggestions for us!
