## Salem Home / Foundation Cross Logo

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If a picture says 1000 words, how much does a logo say about a company?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We worked with the team at the Salem Foundation to create a logo that exemplified who they are as a company and what their values are.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind this design was to create symbols that portrayed a strong yet caring organization. To achieve this we used a combination of bold shapes, solid colours, and clean fonts, with an appropriate amount of negative space between each element to still give the logo a soft feel.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The cross itself is made up of 13 circles to represent the 13 churches that support the Foundation. The colour was sampled from the gold of the Salem Home logo, which is associated with wisdom, understanding and enlightenment. It also represents generosity, giving, compassion and love. We incorporated some perspective onto the cross, making it seem as though you are looking up at it from below. This is to show growth in the foundation and to keep looking ahead at new opportunity and trusting in God to provide.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the type, we wanted the fonts we chose to be bold for strength, yet tie back to the Salem Home logo. We achieved this by using a very similar font for the "Salem" type, and then created some hierarchy by using a simpler font for the word "Foundation".</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Us at Graphic Intuitions have really enjoyed working with the team at Salem Home and loved the opportunity to work on a project like this. Our team is also excited to be working on a new website for Salem Home. Stay tuned!</span>
