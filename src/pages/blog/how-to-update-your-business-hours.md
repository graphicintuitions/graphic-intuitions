Besides posting it at your store or on social media, updating your holiday hours on Google is a great way for people to stay informed.

Now you're set for viewers to see your hours! This can be used to update your hours for any holiday or store closure outside of your regular business hours.

We recommend a Google My Business account as a bare minimum for any business, as this is the information that shows up when someone searches for you in Google. Don't have a Google My Business account?
