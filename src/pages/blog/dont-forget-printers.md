## Manitoba Printers

While most of our recent posts have been about our latest website launches, we don't want to forget about the many print pieces that we've worked on over the past couple of months. This summer, we've designed and printed a number of vehicle decals and many signs for local businesses and organizations including [**Morris Build-All Centre**](http://www.morrisbuildall.com), Blue Diamond Enterprises, [**R.O.C. & The Fern**](http://www.rocf.ca), the Riverview Golf Course and the Manitoba Stampede.

One of our more labour-intensive print jobs has been the National Trailer Parts catalogue. This 356-page parts guide was no small job, but we are very proud with the finished piece! Through our printer contacts, we were able to provide the client with a great looking product that fit within their budget. Here's what Mike Heschel from National Trailer Parts had to say about our work:

_"The team at Graphic Intuitions takes time to understand how we operate as a company. By understanding us, and our customers - they are able to deliver a better product than anyone else."_

Along with the catalogue, we are also in the process of redesigning a new site for National Trailer Parts featuring some pretty awesome dynamic scrolling and functionality. Stay tuned for that launch later this month!
