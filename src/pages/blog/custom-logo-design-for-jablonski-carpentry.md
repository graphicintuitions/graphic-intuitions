<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a client comes in with an exact vision for a new custom logo design, and gets mad when our design looked better than he envisioned - we know we're doing our job! </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jablonski Carpentry</span>](https://www.facebook.com/jablonskicarpentryinc/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> in St. Jean, Manitoba, has "branched out" to not only offer carpentry, but full home builds as well. And so a new custom logo design was needed to show this expansion in the company.</span>

## **Logo Design Rational**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rationale behind this custom [logo design](https://graphicintuitions.com/services/graphic-design/) was to create an iconic mark that could be used as a stand-alone icon as well as a full logo mark.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The icon itself is made up of 3 parts. The first being a tree. Jablonski is a Polish term for apple blossom, and with Jablonski being the owners last name it was obvious that this should be the main focus of the mark.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next challenge was to somehow relate a tree back to construction. To do this we strayed from the typical round shapes used to form the leaves of the tree to a more abstract shape which now resembled the shape of a house.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The final part that needed to be included in the carpentry logo was the use of the 3 tree branches. They wanted three branches to represent their 3 children. When working those in we realized that by tweaking the bends in the branches the way we did, we could also incorporate a sort of hidden feature which was the initials JC (Jablonski Carpentry) into them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we had the main logo nailed down, the client also wanted us to design a few secondary marks for them which would be used on social media, shirts, hats and other promotional products. For these designs, we came up with two different hashtag marks and a secondary JC inc icon to be used as a large sign for their shop.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jablonski Carpentry was extremely pleased with the end result of their full rebrand, which we then consider a huge success. It was a big challenge for us to work in all these elements into a single brand, but with that challenge, it made for a very fun and interesting project for us to work on.</span>
