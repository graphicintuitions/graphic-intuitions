4 Ways Your Website Can Help Your Business
------------------------------------------

### 1\. A Website Allows Your Company To Be Found

Although not completely dead, most people are transferring from the Yellow Pages and referring to Google to provide the information that they need (even Yellow Pages has a website). According to [brafton.com](http://www.brafton.com/news/80-use-search-engines-find-local-product-service-information/), 80% of people use search engines to find local business information, meaning if you don't have an online presence, you're losing a lot of potential customers.

### 2\. A Website Tells a Story About Your Business

When designing a website we want to know your business goals so we can tie them into the website creation. Your [website design](https://graphicintuitions.com/services/website-development/) needs to tie into your branding, company image, business goals, and let customers know how you can serve them. A lot of thought goes into this initial website development stage including how we will help you reach your goals by incorporating company design elements, overall functionality, and getting your message across to customers through imagery and content.

### 3\. A Website Adds Credibility to Your Business

The larger your online presence is, the more likely customers are able to find you. Even Google and other search engines recognize when you have a stronger online presence and actually reward you by giving you better search engine rankings. There are many other ways to boost your search engine rankings as well, see our blog post on [search engine marketing ](https://graphicintuitions.com/whats-brewin/5-ways-sem-can-grow-business/) (SEM).

### 4\. A Website Allows You to Capture Leads

Your online presence brings both your marketing team and sales team together! You don't design a website just to have it sit there and look pretty, a well-designed website ties in multiple sales strategies to generate sales. This is why we meet with both your marketing and sales team before any work is done on a website. We need to know your current strategies, what is working, what is not working, audience profiles, and sales goals your team is trying to reach. Only then can we build a website tailored to capture the leads or sales you are trying to target. Some of the ways we can do this are by adding e-commerce for direct sales, providing education to your visitors or by incorporating lead capture forms. A lead capture form allows you to gather qualified leads to pass along to your sales team.
