The crew was let out early Friday because of the long weekend so we didn't get a chance to do a beer review. (As we hear a collective gasp echoing in the distance.) But fear not, in place of the group beer review we have a staff pick of the week instead! This one comes to you from Shayne. The beer he is suggesting you try is the Ovila Quad made by [**Sierra Nevada Brewing Company**](http://www.sierranevada.com/). This Belgian quad comes in at 10.2% alcohol but has a smooth finish with hints of caramel and raisin. Shayne picked it up on his travels through North Dakota, and he rates this beer a 9 out of 10!

As for this past week, we had a busy one!! Last week we told you about mood boards we were developing for a client. Well this week the mood boards were approved and our designers spent the majority of the week developing the new branding materials for the client. Brochures, rack cards, businesses cards, trifolds and trade show booth design mockups were all required within the course of a few days. Normally this type of work would span over a couple weeks, but our client was facing some deadlines and needed our help. And that means our awesome staff stepped up and buckled down! We will be finishing up the designs this week and sending everything off for printing shortly after, at which point we'll be sure to update you all and reveal this very exciting project! In the meantime, feel free to check out some of our past **[projects](https://graphicintuitions.com/our-work/)**.

While the focus this week was on this branding project, the team also spent time developing a client's blog, laying out a 46-page booklet, making numerous website updates, writing proposals, and that's just the designers and developers! I won't even begin to try to explain what our programmers were up to this week. It's kind of complicated.... and even I don't understand it most of the time. Good thing our team is great at what they do!

September is now upon us which means it's back to school, back to routines and back to reality! We hope everyone had a great summer - what were some of your highlights? We'd love to hear from you!
