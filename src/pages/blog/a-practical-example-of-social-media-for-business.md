This morning our onsite digital marketing training helped to demonstrate the lasting value of using social media for business with Southland Honda, in Winkler, Manitoba.

It was a fantastic cast study - except for one thing - but more on that later.

We used our Instagram account to shoot a quick promotional video about a 2016 Honda CRV. The clip took less than 5 minutes to plan and shoot - and now it can easily be embedded into a website.

Imagine how this kind of video could easily enrich _your_ website!

The Lasting Asset Of Social Media Content
-----------------------------------------

This social media marketing case study shows _how much value a few minutes can create!_ The content is on Instagram... and it's easy to embed into any web page to enrich the content... but more than that -

Instagram also

*   Uploads the video onto our page on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GraphicIntuitions/videos/1031226703599492/),
*   sends a notice to our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GIntuitions/status/748545845755146241) and
*   embeds the video on our [Tumblr](http://graphicintuitions.tumblr.com/post/146708237640/greg-from-southlandhonda-gives-a-tour-of-the) Blog.

One Key Missing Ingredient
--------------------------

_The one thing that is 'missing':_ It would be great if we could include a direct link back to [http://southlandhonda.com](http://southlandhonda.com) in the description under an Instagram video or photo. This option would provide social surfers an easy way to follow through - and might also provide a positive Search Engine Optimization boost.
