**WHAT'S NEW?**  
This edition of our newsletter is all about new. New faces, newly launched sites... It's getting pretty exciting here at Graphic Intuitions! Have a read to see what we've been up to.

**NEW FACES**  
Graphic Intuitions Inc. is excited to welcome a new member to our team. Danni Zhang joins us in our newly created role of Junior Web Developer. Please visit our [team page](https://graphicintuitions.com/about-gi/) to get better acquainted with Danni and our entire crew!

**NEWLY LAUNCHED SITES**  
We've had a number of site launches over the past few months and there are a few we'd like to share with you. The first was TC21.ca - a real estate website built for the Century 21 Tisdale Agencies in Saskatchewan.

![TC21 Responsive](/img/tc21-responsive-223x135.png)What makes this website different is its simplicity. There is a misconception that in order for a website to be functional, it has to have pages upon pages of information. That's not always true. These agents wanted a place for their customers to quickly get their contact information and realty listings. We were able to keep their site limited to just ONE single page. That's all they needed to serve their customers! The real estate website acts like an app, and its responsive design allows it to work well on any mobile device or tablet.

![rempel](/img/rempel-223x135.jpg)The second website we'd like to showcase was created for the Rempel Insurance Brokers in Morris, Manitoba: [www.rempelinsurance.com](http://www.rempelinsurance.com). We created a sleek site that has subtle features that highlight important page elements. When you scroll over certain areas, images might get larger or change colour to bring emphasis to that element. We also added sticky navigation which keeps the navigation buttons "stuck" to the top of the screen so even if you scroll down, you always have access to the navigation buttons without scrolling back up. And of course, this site also has responsive design so it can be used across a number of devices while still performing optimally. Have you upgraded your site to be mobile-friendly? It's becoming increasingly important as people rely on their hand-held devices to get information at their fingertips.

Here are a number of other websites we've launched recently:  
[R.O.C. & The Fern ](http://www.rocf.ca)  
[McTavish Steelworks ](http://www.mctavishsteelworks.com)  
[Bartel Bulk Freight Inc. ](http://bartelfreight.ca/)  
[Infocus Manufacturing ](http://www.infocusmfg.com)

We completed a number of print projects as well, including a few bench signs for our local golf course, some vehicle decals, and this 4x8 outdoor yard sign for R.O.C. & The Fern.

**PRO TIP OF THE MONTH: THE PASSWORD IS NOT PASSWORD**  
This month's pro tip comes to you from Chris C. who agrees that 1234 is not the best password ever created. It might work on your luggage but when it comes to your online security, you might need something a little more complicated. Here's is the first part of Chris' password tip.

_Several uncomplicated words beat a short complex password. For example, "Twl4x9hm" appears to be a strong password, but it would only take an average desktop computer 15 hours to crack. p@ssw0rD is a bad password too, because crackers do these types of common letter substitution in a dictionary attack as well. It's not really any stronger than using one uncomplicated dictionary word. That password would only take about 14 seconds to crack. In addition to being insecure, both of those passwords are hard to remember and hard to type in._

_If you use a password that has multiple words separated by spaces, like the first 5 words from the middle of your favorite song, the password is significantly harder to crack, and very easy for you to remember. For example: "but we are all on common ground" would take about 14 decillion years to crack, and it's from a song I know and will remember easily. It's also easy to type because it's natural language. It's a win-win! Most password fields accept space characters, but even if they don't, "butwearealloncommonground" is still quite secure because of its length and because it's made up of multiple words._

Part two of Chris' password tip, will be in our next newsletter so make sure to watch for it!
