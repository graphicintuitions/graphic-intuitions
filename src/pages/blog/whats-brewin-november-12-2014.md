First off, big news - Julie has tried yet another beer she actually enjoyed. So you know it probably didn't taste much like beer. We'll get into that later. On the work front, we had an array of print projects last week, we launched our new social media services, and our building exterior is done... sort of.

## Print Projects

Our big scale print job last week was sponsorship posters for The Red River Wild hockey team. Brenley, one of our team members, proudly plays with this group of fellas, and Graphic Intuitions is happy to be one of the team's sponsors. These posters, advertising the proud supporters, are on display at the Morris and St. Jean arenas. Go Wild!

On occasion, a rush job comes through our doors and we do our best to accommodate these requests when we can. Last week, we were able to get 2000 flyers printed for a client in one day. We were glad we could assist them in getting the work done quickly!

We also had a few business card projects last week. It's important to remember when you are submitting projects for printing they must be "print-ready". If you aren't familiar with the printer's requirements, let us know and we can help out.

## Social Media Services

![social-media-3](/img/social-media-3.jpg)We've just added a brand new service in order to better assist our customers in achieving their marketing goals. Our social media team will work with you to develop a social media strategy that will amp up your online presence while building a community around your company.

## The Final Reveal (almost)

Well, the renovation part of our exterior building makeover is complete but we have yet to put our logo on the building. We'll call that stage 2 of the project. Our hope is to have the signage up in the next few months, and then we can officially say our renovation project out front is complete. But here's what it looks like so far. What do you think?

## The Beer Review

![fruitesse 1](/img/fruitesse-1.jpg)The beer that didn't taste like beer is the **[Liefmans Fruitesse by The Belgian Beer Company](http://www.liefmans.be/en/fruitesse-on-the-rocks)**. It is described as a fruity, sparkling and sweet, red-coloured beer that is blended with natural juices of blueberry, cherry, juniper, raspberry and strawberry. This is what Julie, our non-beer drinker, had to say about this Belgian fruit beer: "It was delicious as far as beers go. It was fruity but not too sweet with a hint of beer flavour. It could have been marketed as a beer flavoured fruit wine cooler. But who would buy that?"This is exactly why we don't let non-beer drinkers do beer reviews.

Well, that about wraps it up for another edition of "What's Brewin'". We'll see you next week: same time, same place, different beer review.
