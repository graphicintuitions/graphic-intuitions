Graphic Intuitions is excited to announce another website launch, Salem Home!

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Salem Home is a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">personal care home</span>](https://salemhome.ca/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> located in Winkler, Manitoba and serves residents across Southern Manitoba. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been working with the amazing and caring team at Salem Home to create a website that will keep residents, families, staff and the community informed on the organization and facilities. This includes providing information on upcoming events, daily dinner menus, activity schedules, upcoming fundraisers, employment opportunities, and much more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The website design focuses on three main divisions of the organization: Salem Home (facility information), Join the Team (employment opportunities), and Salem Foundation (fundraising initiatives, programs, and achievements). To segment these sections of the website, we utilized different colours so users know which part of the site they are on. Red for Salem Home, orange for Join the Team, and green for Salem Foundation. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important for the website to have a warm, inviting feel to it as well. We accomplished this in a couple of ways, the first of which was to use images of actual nurses and residents of Salem Home. Secondly was the use of a warm colour palette instead of a stark white, cold, clinical feel.  </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two goals the website needed to accomplish were to increase donations to the Salem Foundation and increase the number of employment applications received. We made both donations and employment a focus on the homepage and also provided clear options for Donating or applying for employment on each page of the website, as these are key to the ongoing success of Salem Home.</span>

&nbsp;

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Salem Home's</span>](https://salemhome.ca/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> website is a great example of how thoughtful web design can be used to achieve a company's goals. In all our projects, before anything has started, we take some time to sit with our clients to determine their business goals and together we create a plan achieve them. In this project, we used web design elements to make the most important aspects stand out and create a flow for visitors. This not only promotes Salem Home's business objectives, but is also a better user experience.</span>
