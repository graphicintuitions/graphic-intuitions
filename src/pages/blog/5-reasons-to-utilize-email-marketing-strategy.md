We all have been told that email marketing is important, but why? Is writing content really worth the time? To answer this question simply - yes, it's absolutely worth it! Of course, we won't just leave you with that. Here are five benefits of implementing an email marketing strategy into your business:

5\. Email Addresses are Valuable to Businesses
----------------------------------------------

We are all exposed to ads constantly during our day, whether it be through social media, signage, television, etc., to the point where we often just ignore them because it's not easily apparent which ones are actually showing us something we'd be interested in. But when someone provides you with their email, they have already told you they are interested in what you have to offer, which is a major advantage when it comes to marketing. With this list of email addresses, you can now target customers (or potential customers) directly, which allows for a much higher chance that your message will be seen. Because of this, the return on investment for an email campaign is much greater than attempting to attract and acquire new leads. 80% of professional retailers say email is their best customer retention strategy. So long story short - if you are able to get someone's email address, make sure to use it!

**4\. Stay Top of Mind**
------------------------

Did you know 58% of adults check their email when they wake up? By sending out regularly scheduled emails, it keeps your company at the top of the customer's minds. So next time someone runs out of dog food and they're wondering where to purchase some, for example, they'll think of your company sooner than they would think of your competitor due to the regular contact that you make with them.

3\. Creates Authenticity
------------------------

Reputable email campaigns can create authenticity for your company. By utilizing consistent contact with your clients with professional branding, people begin to familiarize themselves with your brand, creating a relationship. And you know what happens when you build a relationship with customers? On average, nurtured leads make 47% larger purchases than other leads. With these stats, it's crazy that only 7% of small/medium sized businesses are currently utilizing email for brand building, so the chances of you getting a competitive advantage over your competitors are huge!

2\. Targeted Reach
------------------

Email allows you to target each person specifically depending on their needs. By segmenting your target audiences by interests, you are able to provide them with content that is directly relevant. For example, you wouldn't want to send a coupon for cat food to a dog owner. Your clients aren't all the same, and when assuming they are, this can change how effective your email campaigns are. Plus, the more relevant your emails are to your clients, the more likely they are to open your emails, convert from them, and they are less likely to unsubscribe from your list.

1\. Most Importantly - Email Drives Sales!
------------------------------------------

This is what makes all the time spent worth it - seeing results. For every $1 spent on email marketing you get $44 in return. If these stats aren't enough to convince you to begin email marketing, I don't know what is.

Starting an Email Marketing Strategy
------------------------------------

As you can see, having an email marketing strategy in place can significantly help your business by retaining existing customers and drive sales. In order to implement a strong strategy, you need to do a couple things for starters:

*   Grow your email list

*   Create an automated "Welcome..." email series to follow up quickly with new leads and to give them a taste of who they will be dealing with

*   Have fun! How many stuffy, template emails have you received where you only read the first couple of words because "You have seen this all before"? Have a little fun with the email copy but still stay authentic to your brand. It is called "infotainment" and these kinds of emails receive far better engagement

These are just some of the basic strategies to begin utilizing when creating your email marketing strategy. Need help with any of the above?
