Lately, we've been creating many custom icons for our clients to use on their websites. From parcels to car parts, and we're loving it! But why are icons important?

## **Visuals Are Processed Faster Than Text**

Icons, when used properly, can be extremely valuable and aid your viewers in navigating your website, without the need to read content. Visuals are processed 60,000 times faster than text, which means with the correct design and functionality your viewers are able to find what they are looking for faster, allowing you to put emphasis on important aspects of your website.

## **Help Your Customers Find What They're Looking For**

Most people nowadays are skimmers. What we mean by that is very often we don't read the full content block, we look for the highlights, and if we don't find what we're looking for within a few seconds, we leave. This is why pairing icons with titles can be extremely beneficial.

## **Design Overload Can Do More Harm Than Good**

If you haven't already noticed, in this blog we may not be using icons, but we definitely use headers with bold text so you know what you're about to read just by** skimming**. But, _**if**_ I **were** to **bold** **too much** text throughout this **article**, **your** **brain** wouldn't know **where** to _**focus**_. Because of this, you need to decide on your website's primary, secondary, and tertiary goals and match your designs accordingly to make sure your less important goals are not competing with the primary goal of your website. IE. Getting a customer to purchase from you would be more important than a link to download a catalog.
