If you're planning on putting up a sign or billboard to market your business there are a few billboard regulations you need to know. To keep drivers safe and not distracted, there are rules on the design, location, and setup of the sign.

We have included some of the billboard regulations that you will need to abide by, although not all signs need a permit, it's always best to be safe. You can contact [The Highway Traffic Board](https://www.gov.mb.ca/mit/boards/traffic.html) to see if a permit is needed and if so, you can request a permit through them. Permits are generally good for 5 years and only one sign is permitted to be put up by a Provincial Trunk Highway for any business.
