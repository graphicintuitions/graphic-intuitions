<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you're planning on putting up a sign or billboard to market your business there are a few billboard regulations you need to know. To keep drivers safe and not distracted, there are rules on the design, location, and setup of the sign. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have included some of the billboard regulations that you will need to abide by, although not all signs need a permit, it's always best to be safe. You can contact </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Highway Traffic Board</span>](https://www.gov.mb.ca/mit/boards/traffic.html)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> to see if a permit is needed and if so, you can request a permit through them. Permits are generally good for 5 years and only one sign is permitted to be put up by a Provincial Trunk Highway for any business.</span>
