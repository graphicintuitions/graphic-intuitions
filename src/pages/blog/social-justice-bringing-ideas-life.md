## St Jean Social Justice Logo

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month a team from </span><span style="color: #000000;">[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Graphic Intuitions</span>](https://graphicintuitions.com/)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #000000;">,</span> a Southern Manitoba marketing firm, visited </span><span style="color: #000000;">[<span style="font-weight: 400;">É</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cole Regionale Saint-Jean-Baptiste</span>](https://www.dsfm.mb.ca/ScriptorWeb/scripto.asp?resultat=787482)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to work with a group of grade 5-8 students to create a social justice logo. Last summer the students created a social justice club to host events and create awareness within the school and the community about social issues. The goals of the group, as stated by the students, are to gather people together and to help people, not only in the school but in the community as well.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In June the students created logo designs for the social justice club to be used at events and on promotional materials. Graphic Intuitions came in to talk to the students about their logo designs and bring their ideas to life (digitally). Working with the students at St Jean School, we determined what the overall goal was for the logo and what type of image they wanted to portray using the logo design. </span>

## Getting Involved

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We asked the students the following questions:</span>

*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is your audience?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you want your audience to feel when they see your school logo?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What colours should be used for the logo design to help create these feelings?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What symbols should your logo include?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What type of font should be used?</span>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The students provided some great answers that gave us an idea of how they wanted their social justice group to be portrayed. Their audience is the Manitoba community and the students at St Jean School. When others see the logo they want them to feel happy, safe and included. The logo design must also give off a friendly and fun vibe. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The time ended off with the students providing their opinions and drawing up ideas for the logo design. </span>

## The Logo

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After meeting with the students, hearing their ideas, and spending time working out all the details, we came up with a logo that represents the Justice Sociale really well. Below is the final logo design that the students voted on. The concept behind this logo was to create a badge that shows the initials of the club (Justice Sociale) in a fun but professional way. In the centre of the logo are the club initials "JS", and then surrounding them are wings, based off the ones in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">É</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cole St. Jean Baptiste logo. This represents protection and unity between the school and club. The JS on the badge is also in the shape of a person running, which represents the student population.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This same process can be used for any branding project. Graphic Intuitions works closely with businesses and organizations to develop logo designs and branding strategies that best suits their needs.</span>
