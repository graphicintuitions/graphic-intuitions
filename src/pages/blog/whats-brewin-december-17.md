It's the third last What's Brewin' post for 2014. As usual, time flashes before our eyes and we have absolutely no idea where it went. But moving forward is always great! It has been all hands on deck around here with a soft launch of a huge project. Final reveal will be early in the New Year...oh did we just let the cat out of the bag? We do have a new team member so that's always great news! Are you blogging? We discuss why forward-thinkers are blogging, and the reasons why you should too. And of course, there is a beer sampling from the beer **"[Snowcase](http://www.snowcasecalendar.com/)"**.

## The more the merrier!

He met the first criteria - he likes beer. And he just happens to have a few other credentials that work really well for our business. Sal will be heading our sales team, and is looking forward to working with our current clientele to help them develop a full marketing plan that will ignite their business. Here's a bit more about our former Director of Business Development, Sal Loria!

While Sal has amassed experience in sales, project management, marketing, team management and many other areas over the past 20 years he's also come full circle as a member of the Graphic Intuitions team since he used to design websites with Shayne back in the day (with a lot more hair). When he's not obsessively monitoring his clients' projects and stubbornly refusing to think "in the box," Sal's free time consists of three things: his family, basketball and pop culture.

## Why Businesses Need Blogs

Marketing experts believe that content is the new marketing. Creating great content through blogs, podcasts, or videos shared via your website or social media pages, is what will set you apart from your competitors, and launch you as thought leader in your field.

Many brands complain that social media doesn't work for them because they have nothing to post. It's true, if you don't have content you'll have nothing to share! However, if you have a business, and you have a customer base, you must also have knowledge to share. Your success relies on publishing quality content that brings VALUE to your customers, and sharing it through social media channels. This is also how you will attract NEW leads.

**Here are four reasons why blogging is essential in business:**

**1. Increases your SEO (Search Engine Optimization)â€¨**
In simple terms, having an active blog increases your search engine ranking which makes it easier for people to find you using search engines like Google. Search engines use algorithms to organize the content online to decide where your company will show up in a search. By using certain keywords related to your industry consistently, you can increase your ratings considerably.

**2. Blogging keeps you current**
If you are posting content once or twice a week to your company's blog, it will force you to stay on top of current trends and changes in your market. Blogging keeps you accountable to your industry.

**3. Creates an archive of your best thinking**
A blog is the perfect archive of your company's best thinking. Not only does it organize your thoughts by month and categories, it is an invaluable resource when questions come up with your customers. Many business people find themselves answering the same questions over and over again. If this information is contained in your blog, you have a great resource to suggest to people, freeing up your time to focus on other areas.

**4. Conversation and engagement**
Blogs open up conversation with the people you want to talk to: your customers or prospective customers. And often these conversations can spark ideas for future posts and discussion.

So is 2015 the year you start your blog and become a leader in your industry? **[Contact us](https://graphicintuitions.com/get-in-touch/)** to find out how we can get you started!

## Electric Unicorn White IPA - A Fruity Snowcase Showstopper

As we discussed last week, the **[Snowcase](http://www.snowcasecalendar.com/) **Beer Calendar has been taking up space in the Graphic Intuitions fridge for a few weeks but we are slowly making a dent. Half a dozen beers have been sampled thus far but we still have quite a few to go. Here's what our testing panel had to say about the Electric Unicorn White IPA.

![Electric-Unicorn-Label-e1368468747905](/img/Electric-Unicorn-Label-e1368468747905.jpg)

It's an extremely tasty IPA with flavours of pineapple and guava reaching into tropical fruit realm. Subtle hints of pine and an extremely smooth finish. A lighter IPA with a tropical "fruit punch".
