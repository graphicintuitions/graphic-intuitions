## Why Businesses Need Blogs

Marketing experts believe that content is the new marketing. Creating great content through blogs, podcasts, or videos shared via your website or social media pages, is what will set you apart from your competitors, and launch you as thought leader in your field.

Many brands complain that social media doesn't work for them because they have nothing to post. It's true, if you don't have content you'll have nothing to share! However, if you have a business, and you have a customer base, you must also have knowledge to share. Your success relies on publishing quality content that brings VALUE to your customers, and sharing it through social media channels. This is also how you will attract NEW leads.

**Here are four reasons why blogging is essential in business:**

**1. Increases your SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**â€¨\
In simple terms, having an active blog increases your search engine ranking which makes it easier for people to find you using search engines like Google. Search engines use algorithms to organize the content online to decide where your company will show up in a search. By using certain keywords related to your industry consistently, you can increase your ratings considerably.

**2. Blogging keeps you current**\
If you are posting content once or twice a week to your company's blog, it will force you to stay on top of current trends and changes in your market. Blogging keeps you accountable to your industry.

**3. Creates an archive of your best thinking**\
A blog is the perfect archive of your company's best thinking. Not only does it organize your thoughts by month and categories, it is an invaluable resource when questions come up with your customers. Many business people find themselves answering the same questions over and over again. If this information is contained in your blog, you have a great resource to suggest to people, freeing up your time to focus on other areas.

**4. Conversation and engagement**\
Blogs open up conversation with the people you want to talk to: your customers or prospective customers. And often these conversations can spark ideas for future posts and discussion.
