The first question in this series sounds simple, </span>**do I need a website**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> - but our answer may surprise you. So take a couple minutes to hear what our team (experts in [web design](https://graphicintuitions.com/services/website-development/), but unfortunately, not in video production - yet!) have to say, and let us know if you have any questions. Leave us a note about what you would like our next video to answer.</span>[/fusion_text][separator style_type="none" top_margin="30px" bottom_margin="" sep_color="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" class="" id=""][youtube id="RzMMk6fHS-Q" width="600" height="350" autoplay="no" api_params="" class=""][/youtube][separator style_type="none" top_margin="30px" bottom_margin="" sep_color="" border_size="" icon="" icon_circle="" icon_circle_color="" width="" alignment="center" class="" id=""][fusion_text]

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Strategy Behind Website Design</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We get asked to build a lot of websites, but often there is no goal behind this request for website development. The question we want our clients to ask themselves is, why do I need a website? To answer that, we work with you to help determine the goals you are trying to accomplish. We know your website can be so much more than an online brochure, and in some cases, we may even recommend other marketing tools over a website. So take a gander at our video, and hey, let us know if you would like to discuss your business specifically.</span>

_<span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want help planning the goals of your website?</span>_[**_ Download our free questionnaire _**](https://crushyour2018goals.graphicintuitions.com/)_<span style="font-weight: 400;">to help you get started and get thinking about not only if you need a website, but what pieces do you need within the website to make it work for your business and your goals.</span>_

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I Need a Website?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To answer the question, do I need a website, we sit down with our clients and ask what your business goals are. Because we are a full-service digital marketing agency, we take your answers and determine the best way to maximize your budget to get you the best return on investment. This could mean the development of a website, but sometimes different marketing avenues would give you better results.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Are There Other Marketing Strategies I Should Be Using?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people think as soon as they start a business that they need a website. However, you might want to utilize other avenues to make sure customers are interested in what you're offering and determine if a website is the best way to communicate your businesses offering or value to them. By utilizing multiple digital marketing strategies, you will be able to build and foster an audience of customers, whether that be through a website, social media, email marketing or something else. No matter what it is, it all comes back to knowing what your business goals are.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Online Experience > Online Presence</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The online digital experience has changed drastically over the past decade with businesses now being required to be where their audience is and engage with them. Whether that's on specific social media platforms, local online listings, or your website. A large part of creating a website plan actually ties directly into your marketing plan and knowing your audience. Then, and only then, will you be able to make educated decisions on the creation of your website.</span>
