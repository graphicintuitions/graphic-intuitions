TIP #3 - ADD FRESH CONTENT

**Content is KING.**

The purpose of utilizing content marketing in your digital marketing strategy is to attract and retain a clearly-defined audience. Creating fresh content for your website is an investment that can generate sales today, improve your website traffic tomorrow, and serve to draw in new leads and customers for years to come.

**Own Your Website Traffic Instead of Renting It.**

Good content is the cornerstone of Search Engine Optimization and also the key to generating leads and sales over the internet.

Example:

We recently did some search engine specific content updates to a local insurance broker's website in Morris, and as a result, Rempel Insurance now ranks #1 on Google for searches on '[Manitoba Trucking Insurance](https://www.google.ca/search?q=Manitoba+Trucking+Insurance)'! We can help your business too.

Plan your future content to implement keyword strategies that are unique to the needs of your business. Research keyword phrases that your competitors are having success with. Group them, study them.

After identifying the best payday keyword opportunities, it's time to plan for weekly or monthly content updates to systematically integrate the new phrases into the new content throughout the website.

By adding blogging into your digital marketing strategy, you're creating possibilities of ranking for a range of keyword phrases.

*   Create Stellar Original Content
