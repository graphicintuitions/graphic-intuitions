National Trailer Parts has been a long term client that we’ve worked with on multiple projects including custom web design, print catalogs, marketing campaigns, SEO and more. We’ve gotten them some great results over the years, and we want to share with you some of the strategies we used to achieve them.

> “After four months we increased the website traffic by 107%. Over the course of 1 year, web traffic doubled with organic traffic increased by 71%.”

## Website Development

We originally designed and developed the National Trailer Parts website a few years ago. At the time the current website was not responsive and was ready for an update. After a discovery session with the client to better understand their business and goals for the website, we discovered the priorities of the website development included:

* Making the website responsive
* Providing a better user experience for their customers and dealers
* An interactive, custom web design

## Web Design Elements

We wanted to really showcase the company and products in an animated way, which can often be difficult when using themed or templated sites. We created dynamic elements which pop out or move, creating a more interactive and exciting experience for users.

## The Content Management System

The site also required a password protected online catalogue system for their dealers to order products for restocking their inventory. The orders create purchase orders used by the National Trailer Parts accounting team for invoicing. The online catalogue not only has to be easy for the user to navigate and understand, but also include a Content Management System that was easy for National Trailer Parts to maintain. Templated platforms such as WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla are often very limited in their capabilities when custom or business specific systems are required. We were able to produce a system that matched our clients needs all without compromising quality and ease of use.

## Responsive Design

Today, your website has no other option than to be mobile friendly. This trend needs to determine how your website is built. Whether you are viewing the site on a desktop computer, tablet or smartphone, the information displayed is customized to the viewport, meaning you see the most vital information instantly.

## The Digital Marketing

When they were ready, National Trailer Parts came to us to discuss generating more leads on their website. With that goal in mind, we conducted a discovery session with National Trailer Parts, reviewed their analytics data, and created a plan to achieve their goals.

## Tracking ROI

When we start any digital marketing project, we want to be able to track the return on investment for any campaign. When National Trailer Parts began working with us on their digital marketing, they had Google Analytics setup but no website conversion tracking. As we were going to start running ads, we added tracking to the website to determine how many people that visited converted into a lead. This tracking was not only beneficial to track the ads but the conversions on the entire website. This is what we found after just a few weeks of tracking:

* Which traffic sources generated the highest conversion rate
* Which ads were performing the best. This could be used to update and optimize results

Organic search traffic (Google searches) had the highest conversion rate. So using a little deductive reasoning, increase the traffic source = increase the number of website leads. To do this we implemented search engine optimization (SEO) strategies. After four months we:

* Increased the website traffic by 107%
* Over doubled website traffic compared to the same time the previous year,, with organic traffic increased by 71%

With the tracking we added, we could also see a conversion rate of 13.65% from organic search traffic.

National Trailer Parts sells, you guessed it, trailer parts! Based out of Swift Current, Saskatchewan, they service customers from British Columbia all the way to North Western Ontario and have been in business since 1992. Here is what Mike Heschel from National Trailer Parts had to say about our working relationship:

> “The team at Graphic Intuitions takes time to understand how we operate as a company. By understanding us, and our customers – they are able to deliver a better product than anyone else.”
