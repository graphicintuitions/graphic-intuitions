"Great! My hot water tank just sprung a leak, and there is water everywhere. And of course it's the weekend. Who am I going to call to fix this before we have a small flood in our basement?"

And this is where most people get on their mobile phones or computers and start searching Google for local plumbers. Phone books are a thing of the past, and word-of-mouth business can only get you so far. Without a website, you've completely shut the door on a pool of potential clients. Just because you own a small business, it doesn't mean your company isn't worthy of a website. That's where we come in - we want to make your small business a BIG deal because it IS a big deal.

Here are the top 5 reasons having a website is important for small businesses:

**1\. Increased Visibility  
**Are you at your office 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? We didn't think so, but thankfully, your website is always there like a full-time receptionist fielding questions. Of course, a website does not replace YOU but it can sure hold down the fort until you're back in the office and ready to assist customers.

**2\. Instant Credibility  
**Having a website puts you in a different league when it comes to credibility. It automatically makes your business look more professional, as long as your website looks professional. This is not the time to save money and cut corners. Work with a trusted web design team that can tailor a professional website to fit your budget.

**3\. 24/7 Advertising  
**Your website is the BEST advertising you can get. It not only tells potential customers who you are and what your company's values are, it gives them a list of the services and products you can provide, and what sets you apart from your competitors.

**4\. Analysis of Customers' Behaviour  
**All of our websites are designed with Google Analytics built-in which means you have customer analysis at your fingertips any time you need it. You can find out where your customers are coming from, what percentage are male and female, what pages of your site they are looking at the most, so on and so forth.

**5\. Opening up your business to the world  
**Obviously if you're a local service person, this may not apply to you as much but having a website gives your company access to customers around the world. Having a website breaks down geographical borders. Who says you can't sell your product to someone in Saudi Arabia? The world is your market place!

We started as a very small company so we understand how building a website and talking to a marketing company can be a little daunting. We work with all sizes of businesses to find a website that will honour the essence of your company, no matter how small. **[Contact us](https://graphicintuitions.com/get-in-touch/)** today to open your business up to a whole new world of possibilities!
