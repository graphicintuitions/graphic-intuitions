## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Website Strategy Series - Part 2 </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In our </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">first GI Wonder video</span>](https://graphicintuitions.com/whats-brewin/do-i-need-a-website/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, we touched on how your business goals determine if you need a website or not. Now, we want to take this a step further and explain the type of goals you should set and why for your website development. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will also take you through an example of a client who came to us with website issues, and some of the business goals we were able to achieve through rebuilding their website.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Why are Goals so Important? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Setting goals are such an important thing to do prior to developing a website or creating a marketing campaign and there are two equally weighted questions that need to be answered before development begins. These are "what are my goals?" and "who are my target audiences?".</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Goals help to make decisions that drive the development of your website, and the audiences determine how you accomplish those goals. We will be going more in-depth with audiences in our next video. The key is though, be as specific with your goals as you can. The reason for this is the more specific you are, the easier it is to track your website's results. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, don't just say "I want to increase sales". Be specific. What product or service are you wanting to increase sales for? By how much? Where do you see your greatest opportunity? Which of your audiences are you wanting to see the increased sales from?</span>

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">An Example of Our Own - Runnin' Red</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A great example of properly setting goals for a website was with a client of ours, [Runnin' Red](https://www.runninred.com/). They are a local courier company who also do cross-border pickups. They wanted to increase the number of cross-border pickups. Most of these, however, were coming via phone calls, and they wanted to make this process more automated. We also found out that the online request form had issues. About 10% of the form submissions would go missing.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that we knew the priority of the website was the cross-border pickups that needed to be acquired via the online request form, we could use this to plan the [web development](https://graphicintuitions.com/services/website-development/). Their current website had the cross-border service link in their main navigation but there were no callouts on the home page directing traffic to it. Our thought was, why don't we bring the form to the customer? Why not have it located right on the homepage so it would be visible immediately?</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, we took a look at the form itself on the existing site. It was daunting to fill out, to say the least. A user had to scroll through and complete countless form fields all on one long page. The user experience was overwhelming. We decided to break the form into a five-step process with at the very most, three form fields to complete at a time. This made for a much simpler and less daunting process.</span>

&nbsp;

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">How Goals Helped Runnin' Red</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As we mentioned, the more precise the goal, the easier it is to track. Our goal was to increase the number of online cross-border pickup form request submissions. We set up event tracking to see how many submissions were being sent through on a daily basis. However, we took the tracking to the next level and added event tracking on each stage of the form. This way we could see if users were dropping off at a certain stage.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve zero form submissions lost, we completely rewrote the form code and also added in error tracking. The error tracking would notify us of any code errors a user would experience so these could be taken care of immediately. This is a proactive approach instead of a reactive approach where you are only notified of the error when you receive a complaint from an angry customer.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When we were all said and done with the website rebuild, we had made the primary goal of the website, cross-border pickups with the main focus on the homepage. We simplified the form submission process, implemented form stage and submission tracking, and also added in proactive form error code tracking.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke with the owner a month after the launch of the website and were excited to hear that cross-border pickups were at an all-time high. They also hadn't received a call from one customer about a lost form submission since the launch.</span>

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Conclusion</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So to wrap up, be sure to answer two questions before you look at developing a website or creating a marketing campaign. What are your goals and who is your target audience? The more precise your goals, the easier they are to track. In our next video, we will expand upon audience profiles and why they are so important.
