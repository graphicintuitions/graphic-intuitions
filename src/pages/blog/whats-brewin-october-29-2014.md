We haven't launched any new sites in a few weeks because the projects we are working on are big scale projects that demand a lot of our time. We can't complain about that! We've also been busy submitting exciting proposals for some really, really big projects. Looks like a busy few months ahead for Graphic Intuitions.

Holiday Cards and Calendars
---------------------------

Yes, we realize the trick-or-treaters haven't even been out yet, but when it comes to holiday cards and calendars, you have to get a jump on these things. Before you know it, the stockings will be hung on the chimney with care, and your Christmas cards and calendars will be nowhere. We have just sent out some reminder cards about this so check your mailboxes.

We can design and print your cards while keeping your company's branding and messaging at the forefront. There is something to be said about sending out greetings that are personalized. It suggests quality and professionalism. Contact **[Julie](mailto:julie@teamgi.ca)** - she can get you in the holiday spirit. Maybe she can sing you a carol or two. Actually, scratch that. That might take you OUT of the holiday spirit.

Social Media Services
---------------------

![social-platforms](/img/social-platforms.jpg)We are very excited to be able to offer social media services to our customers. We will sit down with you and decide which of our social media packages will work best with your company. From there, we can plan a social media strategy that will ignite your online marketing, bringing new business through your doors. We will be officially launching this new service next week so keep checking back for details!

The New Face of Graphic Intuitions
----------------------------------

It's been a very loud few days at G.I. as a dedicated crew tears down the old stucco on the front of our building to make way for the beautiful new brick and siding that will take its place. Here's a progress shot - if you want to see the reveal picture, it will be in our November Newsletter next Monday. **[Sign up](https://graphicintuitions.com/)** for our newsletter today!
