The holiday season innately gives people those warm and fuzzy feelings that helps make them happy and productive shoppers. Here are a few ideas that can help amp up your customer service during the festive season and give your customers a great holiday shopping experience.

*   play holiday music
*   dress festively - holiday pjs, antlers, a bit more formal than usual, santa hats, festive name tags
*   provide apple cider or hot cocoa for customers. Cookies and holiday baking never hurt either!
*   Inject Christmas smells in the air like cinnamon, cloves. Scentsy is a great clean way to add a lovely scent to your space. My personal favourite is Christmas Cottage.
*   Make sure to wish your customers a happy holiday, Merry Christmas, etc. And make sure to thank them for their continued patronage or, if they are a new customer, thank them for coming to your store.
