<span style="font-weight: 400;">UX stands for "User Experience". The user experience on a website has a major impact on how it will convert and perform. Good UX web design should take users through their journey, from discovery to conversion and everywhere in between. Not optimizing your website for your users has a huge negative impact on your website's return on investment. [79% of people who don't like what they find on one site will go back and search for another site](https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/user-experience-stats-infographic). </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lost users mean lost revenue. So how do you optimize your website for users?</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Make Your Website's Message Clear</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone lands on your website, they should be able to answer a few things:</span>

*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Who you are</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What you do</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Why I (the customer) should care</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">What should I do next</span>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Most businesses get the first one down just fine, but the other three are commonly not thought out in the website's design. There are many ways to optimize your website. However, here are some examples we commonly see and advise against:</span>

&nbsp;

1.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Using stock imagery that doesn't show who you are and what you do. Images are processed by the brain much faster than text. Are the images on your site portraying the right message?</span>
2.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Focusing on you instead of them. In the 50s it might have worked to say what you do and people would come to you, but now you need to show people what's in it for them. Is it worth their time to look through your website? What are they going to get out of it?</span>
3.  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The most common and scariest one we see is the lack of any call-to-action. And no, just having a contact page on your website does not count. Even if your goal is for people to contact you directly, let people know that throughout the website. Let them know what they can expect when they contact you to get them comfortable with completing the action.</span>
&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Design Enticing Calls To Action</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You just took the time to create some great content to get people excited about what you offer. You include it on your website and wait for people to contact you. Well wait, did you tell people how to get this amazing offer? It's easy to assume people know how to do business with you, but always try to think of new customers who have never heard of you. What would they need to know? What would resonate with them and cause to act?</span>

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Optimize Your Website Usability</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your website does not function in a way that makes completing a customer's goal easy, they will leave. Some key things you need to check on your website include website speed, mobile friendliness, and ease of navigation.
