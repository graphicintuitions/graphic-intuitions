TIP #1 - UPDATE YOUR WEBSITE!

If your website is looking tired and neglected, it may need more than a cleaning - it could need a little refresh. But this is something that will take some planning and forethought.

☐ **Get organized**: Is key information easy to find? If not, step back and decide if what you need is a re-write or if the problem stems from your navigation that good web design could fix.

☐ **Check for clarity**: Have an objective person read through your content to proof-read (for typos, unnecessary jargon or "sector-speak") and clean-up or tighten up your key content.

☐ **Freshen web design**: Take some time to think about what your website's design conveys and whether there are some small changes that might make it more welcoming or easier to use (e.g., a different font or fewer typefaces? A new background colour? Additional images, etc.). Just remember - plan website revisions carefully since some small changes might end up having a domino effect and lead to a major overhaul!

We hope our Spring Cleaning tips now have your website in tip-top shape! A clean, SEO friendly, easy to navigate website full of fresh content will bring in the right audience and start to send the traffic through the virtual or brick and mortar doors!
