Can your website design really make a difference in your bottom line? The short answer, yes. But we'll let you know why by making ourselves a little vulnerable (eek!) and giving you some insight into our analytics.

**The Importance of Website Design**
------------------------------------

As you may have already known, our new website FINALLY launched back in February. We updated the look and experience, and implemented tracking so we could see what pages users were visiting, how long they were staying there, how much traffic we were getting, etc. It was pretty amazing to see the results!

**The Results**
---------------

In 1.5 months since our launch, our traffic had gone up by 47% compared to the previous period and 116% compared to the previous year! Not only were we getting more traffic, but we were getting better traffic. Our bounce rate dropped dramatically from 62% to 15%, meaning that people are not "bouncing" out of the site after they enter. We also saw an increase in new visitors of 56%.

**How Did We Get These Results?**
---------------------------------

There were quite a few contributing factors that helped us to achieve these results, we'll talk about three.

#### **1\. Responsive Design**

More and more users are viewing websites on their phones or tablets. With this trend, businesses need to accommodate these viewers by creating a user experience as good as or better than the desktop version of their website in order to keep them engaged. Our old website was not mobile friendly, which had an impact on our traffic. Prior to our launch, we were getting a bounce rate of 62% for mobile. After launching our website we saw the bounce rate decrease to an all-time low of 8.8%! Awesome right? The industry average for bounce rate on a site like ours is 60%, meaning we're blowing them out of the water!

By looking at the data our old site had, we were able to tell that a new website was needed, which would not have been possible to see without proper tracking in place. Tracking allowed us to see which areas our site were performing well and which areas were under performing. For example, when determining what our new site needed, we could see that the web page that received the most visits was our portfolio. This is why when you visit our new home page you see work that we've done using a large graphics guiding users into our portfolio.

#### **2\. Easy Navigation**

When designing a website, we plan out in advance what the sitemap will be, keeping in mind the experience that we want to give customers. The design of a website needs to have easy navigation allowing customers to find information quickly. If this is not the case they may just leave and go to your competitors' website. The website design also needs to lead customers in a direction that you want to take them. Want to convert leads? Maybe have a "Request A Quote" form on your high traffic pages.

When you visit our new website, you should know exactly what type of company we are. The homepage has it in big bold lettering, "We are a full service marketing agency". The website then continues to show all of our services available. Viewers can then continue on to browse our website and see what we have to offer.

#### **3\. Search Engine Optimization**

Ok, ok, we know Search Engine Optimization (SEO) isn't exactly a design feature, but regardless, this really helped our website to be found and this is something we implement into all websites as they are being designed and developed. It was no easy feat but as the developers were coding the website, our digital marketing team worked on creating original content that was search engine optimized and revisited our old blog posts to tune up their SEO. Our digital marketing team and designers worked together to make sure the content that went onto our site not only portrayed the voice we wanted it to have, but was search engine optimized and fit into the layout.

Notice a trend? Everything is being tracked. Let's be honest, every website has a purpose. It may be to sell products online through an e-commerce system. Or it may be to acquire more dealers to sell your product. It might be to inform potential customers about services you offer and get them to book appointments. Once you know the goals of your website, you need to be tracking them. If you are not implementing features to track and analyze the results of your goals, then you are just throwing your money away. There is now way to know if that print advertisement brought traffic into your website or if that online campaign about your new product worked. With proper tracking, you will know the exact return on investment on all your advertising, including your website. Oh ya, and guess what? We're tracking this too.
