We are oh so excited to share the grand unveiling with you! After having our website on the back burner to finish up some work for clients, and a lot of back and forth at our end, our website is finally live!

Everyone here had such great ideas for the website design it was hard to settle on all the details. But we finally decided we have to stop tweaking the website and get it up for everyone to see! Because this website is definitely something that we want to share.

We put a lot of heart into this project and here's the result:

*   Mobile friendly design

*   Looks awesome

*   SEO friendly

*   Lead captures on multiple pages

*   Looks awesome

*   Showcases our work

*   Custom website design

And did we mention that our new website looks awesome, thanks to our developers and graphic designer.

We could go on and on about what the website features, but we think you should really go and check it out for yourself.

Celebratory Beer Review
=======================

To celebrate, our team cracked open a cold one, not like we needed an excuse.  
![Pinot Suave](/img/Pinot-Suave.png)

Pinot Suave from [Deschutes Brewery](https://www.deschutesbrewery.com/beer/pinot-suave/) made a bad first impression but came in with a solid finish and an average rating of 6.96/10. When first opened this brew had a smell of "bad apple juice". But given a chance, this brew made a smooth come back with its oaky, sour flavour that tasted like a combination of beer and wine. An easy sipper on any night.

These are the ratings:

Chris: 7.6  
Julie: 6  
Shayne: 7.65  
Mark: 2.5  
Nick: 8  
Shar: 7  
Dave:10

If Mark rates higher than a 2, then you know it's worth a try.
