Online reviews are crucial for any business and most customers can be swayed to purchase (or not purchase) a product based on them. Online reviews are the new word of mouth marketing, 80% of people trust reviews as much as a personal recommendation, according to Vendasta, an online reputation management platform. And did you know 92% of people now check online reviews before making a purchase? With that number of potential customers looking at your reviews, it is imperative that you know how to take control of the conversation. Obviously, you can't control what people are saying, but you can try to control the outcome by knowing how to respond to reviews.

&nbsp;

Remember that you don't only want to reply to negative reviews, but to positive reviews too! Letting customers know that their feedback is appreciated is great rapport and can even create brand advocates! Who wouldn't want that?

&nbsp;

Now for the not-so-fun, part. Negative reviews can be detrimental if left unattended, however, if handled correctly, negative reviews can help to resolve the situation and can show customers that you care about them. When a negative review comes in, be sure to follow these key points:

*   Respond as soon as possible, otherwise, it gives opportunity for other customers to see the negative review that was left unattended

*   Reply using a reading level that is easy for anyone to understand

*   Do not add unnecessary details and aim to move the conversation offline

*   In your reply be sure to include: A thank you, an apology, a solution, and finally take the contact offline
