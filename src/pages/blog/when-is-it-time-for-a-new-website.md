<span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you know when it is time for a new website? Like a car, sometimes it just makes more sense to put some money into repairs, but other times it may make more sense to upgrade to something else entirely. Consider these things when you are thinking of giving your web design an overhaul or just making updates to what you currently have.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Your Website Meeting Your Business Goals?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What were your goals when you first built your website? Have your goals changed? Does your current website help in achieving your business goals? If not, a web design may be recommended in the very near future. Your website should be a 24/7 sales tool, and if it's not contributing to the growth of your business, why are you paying for it? This is one of the major differences between cheap and a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">professional web design agency</span>](https://graphicintuitions.com/whats-brewin/why-are-websites-so-expensive/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, any agency you work with should consider the goals you have for your business in the development of the new website.</span>

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Does Your Website Work on Mobile Devices?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Google has changed to index mobile first websites. This means if your website does not work on mobile devices, Google penalizes you which can allow your competitors to appear first in search results. Note that part of a website being mobile friendly is quick load time. If your website takes long to load, you will be penalized for this as well.</span>

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Does Your Web Design Match Your Business's Branding?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple tweaks such as colour changes or a logo update can be quite simple to make on a website, but if you've recently rebranded and given everything an overhaul, it may be easier to start fresh when it comes to your web design, especially if your website is outdated, too busy, or the imagery doesn't reflect your brands personality to cater to your target audience. </span>

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">What Are You Spending On Website Updates?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Back to the car analogy, once you've reached that point where the repairs cost just as much as the vehicle, you really consider if it's worth it. Of course, even with a new website, you will still have some maintenance as needed to keep your website free of security issues and up to date on industry trends (new cars still need oil changes after all). But a new website can lower that cost of updating any outdated or broken pieces on your website.</span>

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Is Your Website Being Found Or Generating Leads?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your website is not generating leads and potential customers are not able to find it, you may have a problem that cannot be solved by building a new website. To give a definitive answer to this question, we would need to take a look at your site to determine factors such as,</span>

*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it outdated?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Has the website been optimized for search engines to find it?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Is the website currently being indexed?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there links back to your website?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it take a long time to load or are things broken?</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you competing with a lot of competitors to appear in search results?</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Being found online needs to include a variety of strategies that stretches beyond the design of your website, and into your digital marketing.
