We will never turn down a good cookie. Especially when it's from a good client! We received a delicious gift from our friends at **[Hemp Oil Canada](http://www.hempoilcan.com/)** last Friday in the form of yummy hemp cookies.

&nbsp;

Here are some of the comments shared by our staff about these gastronomical gems.

**Julie:** Airy and not too sweet with hints of pumpkin but not overpowering. Sweet pillows of happiness fit for human consumption.

**Shayne:** Moist and just the right amount of pumpkin to chocolate ratio. Reminds me of the cookies Baba used to make!

**Danni:** I loved them. Not too sweet. And soft.

We've discovered that the secret to a happy life lies in cookies and beer.
