## Is Google Marking Your Website Not Secure?

Google's newest version of Chrome is making it safer for users to browse the internet, but how does this affect you? In its first release, Chrome will label websites that handle client login or payment information as not secure if your site does not have an appropriate SSL certificate. Your website visitors may see this website not secure message when they log into your site:

This change that marks your website not secure can have an impact on the traffic and sales of your website if your customers don't feel safe using and purchasing on your website.

In Google's second push, they are planning on marking all websites without HTTPS as not secure, regardless if you have a client login or receive payments.
