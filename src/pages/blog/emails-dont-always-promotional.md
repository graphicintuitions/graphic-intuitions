Not all correspondence to your email list needs to be promotional in nature. Actually, it should always be a mix of promotions, tips and general information about your business. Towards the end of the holiday season, take a few minutes to personally thank your customers by sending them a holiday email and to wish them a wonderful holiday season. Here is an example of a holiday email you could send to clients:

_Dear (name):_

_We wanted to personally thank you for being such an important part of our success by supporting us with your patronage and referring your friends and family to our business. We feel very fortunate to be able to serve such a great community._

_Our wish for you this holiday season is continued happiness and health and the warmth of family and friends wrapped around you - because that is what this time of year is really all about._

_Thanks again for being such an important part of what we do. We look forward to seeing you in the New Year!_

_Sincerely,_

_(name)_
