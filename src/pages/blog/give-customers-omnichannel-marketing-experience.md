<span style="font-weight: 400;">Omnichannel marketing is the cohesiveness of all your marketing channels and internal systems in order to create a unified customer experience. Having a well constructed omnichannel marketing system allows customers to contact you on every channel and have the same level of customer service. However, this experience should still be customized for the platform they are using. In today's market, customers expect businesses to do this, but many fall very short. In fact, 87% of customers think brands need to put more effort into providing a seamless experience.</span>

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Is Omnichannel Marketing Important?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest benefit to implementing an omnichannel experience is customer service and experience. Making it simpler for the customer, this gives them the ability to contact and do business with you on whichever platform that's easiest for them. Whether that's by using Facebook messenger for customer support or visiting a retail store about a product they found on the website. Plus, businesses that adopt omnichannel strategies achieve 91% greater year-over-year customer retention rates. Remember, happy customers equal repeat purchases and referrals!</span>

&nbsp;

## <span style="font-weight: 400;">How To Implement Omnichannel Marketing</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an omnichannel marketing experience can be quite a daunting task. It requires finding systems that integrate together and filtering through the storehouse of information held, not to mention training staff to use these systems. Here are a few things to keep in mind and get started when implementing your strategy.</span>

&nbsp;

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Start With Your Base</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If your internal systems are a mess, providing an omnichannel experience won't work. Having a CRM is a starting point into fixing this issue. All salespeople and support staff need to be able to have a centralized system with all customer information. Your inventory system plays another large roll in this; particularly finding something with real-time information for customers.</span>

&nbsp;

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Automate What You Can</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many businesses are still stuck with the problem of manual data entry. The problem with this is the lack of real-time data and errors in the information inputted. Chances are, if there is a process that takes hours of manual data entry, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">custom programming</span>](https://graphicintuitions.com/services/programming/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> or tie-ins can solve this for your business.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Make Use Of Your Data</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">People trust you with their data if it's going to make their lives easier and mean they get more relevant information. ie. </span>

*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">The remarketing ads that follow them on Instagram with products they looked at online</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Abandoned cart emails with a discount</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Segmented emails based on their interests and past purchases</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When your channels are merged together properly, this allows you to hyper-target messages to your audiences and gives your </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">marketing </span>](https://graphicintuitions.com/services/digital-marketing/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">a higher return. Therefore, ensure all of your tracking pixels are working properly.</span>

&nbsp;

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on the Customer Experience</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When creating your omnichannel marketing strategy, put the customer experience first. How will each of the channels you use help your customers? Is there a disconnect between two of them that would inconvenience your customer, such as making them need to repeat information? Each channel's strategy needs to be customized to work with the audience that uses that channel, but it also needs to tie in strategically to your other channels. </span>
