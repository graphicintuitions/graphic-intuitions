October: A time to reflect on the beauty of the fall landscapes, a time to pull out the jeans and chunky wool scarves, and a time to be hit over the head with all things PUMPKIN. Including beer. So let's start there.

It seems Julie is a fan of all things pumpkin so she keeps bringing in pumpkin flavoured delicacies for us to try like Oreos, Hershey's Kisses, coffee creamer, and beer of course. (By the way, we will be doing a full pumpkin food frenzy review on Halloween. Mark it in your calendars.)

If you want to get your pumpkin-flavoured alcohol on, Red Racer Spiced Pumpkin Ale from **[Central City Brewers and Distillers](http://centralcitybrewing.com/) **is a good place to start. That's the beer we sampled last Friday afternoon. It seemed fitting for the third day of October. Here's what we had to say about it:

• "It's got a good nose on it"
• "It's pumpkin-y but doesn't taste like pie, that's for sure."
• "Feels like Halloween." I'm not entirely sure what that means.

The overall rating given to this beer was 4.5 pumpkins out of 10. While it wasn't our most highly-rated beer of all time, it definitely got points for bringing spirit to the fall season, and reminding us that pumpkins have their place. In pie.

**Flaman Fitness**
We did get some big projects completed last week - work before beer. We completed a website refresher for long-time client, **[Flaman Fitness](http://www.flamanfitness.com)**. Some of their marketing materials had been updated and the website had to follow suit to ensure cohesiveness across all their marketing platforms. We also added some sweet features to their site:

• In-store pickup shipping option
• Online payment system
• Setup product discounts specific to certain companies

It's always nice to work with long-time clients - you know the business well and can jump right in with both feet to get the work done.

**Hemp Oil Canada**
![hemp oil brochure](/img/hemp-oil-brochure-582x1024.jpg)After they bribed us with cookies last week, we made sure we got [**Hemp Oil Canada**](http://www.hempoilcan.com/)'s brochures completed and ready for their upcoming trade show in a jiffy. After the first glance, the client loved the look but wasn't sure the content they had added was going to fit the original trifold they were thinking of doing. So our brainy graphic designers suggested changing the trifold brochure into a gate fold to give them more page real estate. This is pretty much as exciting as it gets in the world of a graphic designer, folks; things moving and changing at the speed of light! With the new gate fold, we were able to keep the integrity of the design while still providing enough space for the content. Signed, sealed and delivered, they're yours - thanks Hemp Oil Canada! Hope the brochures help your business grow. Like a hemp seed.

Next week: more beer, more cool clients to help, more pumpkin-flavoured food to ingest.
