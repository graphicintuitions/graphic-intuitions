Welcome to day 1 of our holiday marketing challenge! Today we are encouraging you to send a holiday email to your client list to remind them of the great offers and products you have in these last few weeks before Christmas. Here are some tips on creating compelling subject lines.

The subject line is the key factor in determining whether or not someone looks at your email. If you're subject line doesn't jump out in your customer's over-flowing inbox, it just doesn't matter. The other thing to consider when writing productive subject lines for email marketing is how relevant the topic is to your customer. If it doesn't speak to them or bring them some kind of value, what's the point?

Here are a few types of different subject lines that convert into higher open rates. Give them a try in your next mailer!

## 1. Make them laugh

If you can get them with a few chuckles, they are more likely to open your email to see exactly what you have to talk about.

_Example: Fearing the Turkey-pocolypse? Watch How to Survive Thanksgiving on YouTube (Youtube Broadcast Newsletter)_

## 2. Lists

Most marketers will tell you that there is something deep inside the depths of the human mind that make people attracted to lists. The reason may be because lists suggest easy steps someone can take immediately to achieve a goal. Plus they usually contain a strong call to action.

_Example: Three steps you can take today to increase your holiday sales!_

## 3. Testimonials

Name dropping works well even in email marketing! If you have a client who is well-known who uses your products or services, why not use that in a subject line? You may want to ask this person for their permission if you know them personally.

_Example: Why Arnold Palmer Uses Quaker State Motor Oil._

## 4. How-to

How-to subject lines also create a strong call to action. If you can provide people with tips to improve their home or work life, they will be more willing to open your email.

_Example: How to increase the ROI with your PPC advertising._

## 5. News

If you have news to share with your customers that will affect their business, whether it's positive or negative, use that as your subject line.

_Example: Facebook is making changes to their privacy policy. Are you ready?_

&nbsp;

By utilizing these types of subject lines, you'll notice a difference in the amount of engagement your email receives. Mail Chimp has also suggested that certain words used in subject lines tend to produce lower open rates. The words they suggest you avoid are: _free, help, percent off _and_ reminder_.

We hope these subject line writing tips will help you in your next email marketing campaign! What subject lines do you find most effective when launching an email marketing campaign?
