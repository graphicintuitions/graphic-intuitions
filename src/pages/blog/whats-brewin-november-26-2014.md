Today we are skipping the beer review for a beer/wine APP review - shaking it up! We're still working on some big projects that require lots of time so no big launches this week. We're looking forward to the new year when a bunch of projects will be ready to reveal. There's some pretty cool stuff happening!

## Saskatchewan Young Ag-Entrepreneurs (SYA) Poster

We designed a poster for **[Saskatchewan Young Ag-Entrepreneurs](http://www.saskyoungag.ca/)**. We've worked with this organization in the past and we're always happy to give them a hand. The client needed a poster to advertise their upcoming conference for young farmers and advisors. As long as we got the important information across, they gave us creative freedom to design it how we wanted. That's always a lot of fun!

Here's the final look:

## Decals and Labels

They are not the most glamorous of projects we work on but even the smallest marketing materials have an impact on the look and feel of your brand, and how it represents your business. This week we had some truck decals and labels printed for customers. Is your branding consistent throughout your entire organization? Are you happy with the message it conveys to your customers? Here are a few reasons good branding is important:

*   Delivers the message clearly
*   Confirms your credibility
*   Connects your target prospects emotionally
*   Motivates the buyer
*   Solidifies User Loyalty
We can evaluate your company and create a brand strategy that will tell your customers who you are and what makes you stand out. Everything from colour to font conveys a message about your brand. Do you know what yours is saying?

## There's an App for That

As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, we don't have a beer review today like we normally do, but we have an app review which will heighten your beer and wine consuming experience. And that's just as good in our opinion!

**[Next Glass](http://nextglass.co/)** is a free app available for Android and iOS. What it does is it learns your taste profile as you rate wine and beer. That way, when you shop, you can use the app to scan new bottles that you might want to buy, and you will be able to tell if it matches your palate. You can see your friends ratings too, and it has a calorie counter. Pffft... Calorie counter... In a nutshell, the more you drink and rate, the better the app will be able to suggest beverages that will fit your specific tastes. So get drinking... responsibly of course.

November is coming to a close and there's just one month left in 2014, and we're hoping to end it with a bang! What's Brewin' will be back next week with the beer advent calendar, and work stuff of course, because that's important too.
