**What is SEO?** Search Engine Optimization is the tactics used to optimize your website to be more easily found by search engines such as Google, Bing, or Yahoo. These search engines use their algorithms to determine which website's will appear first in someone's search to try to make it as relevant as possible to the user. By knowing about these algorithms, you are then able to optimize your website to (hopefully) appear above your competitors on a search.

## **Is SEO Important?**

Yes, search engine optimization is important for any business. We've seen it time and time again that our clients have gotten more leads on their website based on the fact that they increased their website traffic with relevant users which in turn increased the number of conversions.

## **What You can do to Improve Your SEO**

There are all sorts of tactics used to improve your SEO. Amongst many more, these are some of the basic things that you can do to enhance your website's search-ability:

*   Ensure your website displays properly on all devices including mobile, desktop, and tablet
*   The content on your website is relevant to what someone is searching
*   Use commonly searched for keyword terms in your website's page titles
*   Don't overcrowd your website with ads or annoying popups that make it difficult to see your website's content
*   Create listings on reliable websites that link to yours to show legitimacy
&nbsp;

## **What is The Cost of SEO**

The investment in SEO greatly varies and depends on your website. If you sell products online, you would want each product category optimized and therefore with the extra pages it would take a lot more work than a simple 3-page brochure style website. Typically, SEO is something that should be continually worked on as keyword trends and algorithms change; your competitors don't stand still so it's a competitive market and you need to work with someone that can find ways to get results within this highly competitive market. Search engine optimization is something that we highly recommend for any business because [91% of online adults](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanerskine/2017/09/19/20-online-reputation-statistics-that-every-business-owner-needs-to-know/#6bddf4d2cc5c) use Google or other search engines to find information.
