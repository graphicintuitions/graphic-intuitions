### ![Wild_blue_beer](/img/Wild_blue_beer.jpg)Beer Review

This week's beer review is by Julie, the non-beer drinker, and it's called **[Wild Blue Blueberry Lager](http://wildbluelager.com/)** by Wild Dawg Brewing Company. Although Julie is normally more of a wine drinker, the funny cartoon dog on the label sucked her right in. Who says marketing isn't important? We know better! According to Julie, the beer was surprisingly delicious mostly because it didn't taste like a traditional beer. It had a hint of blueberry and tasted more like a sweet wine cooler than a lager. She finds when a beer claims it tastes like a specific fruit you usually can't taste that fruit too strongly, but that is not the case with the Wild Blue Blueberry Lager. It's blueberry-rific! This beer literally "blue" Julie away. Non-beer drinkers, this one might win you over!

### Website Launches

Now on to real business... We just launched a brand spanking new website for **[National Trailer Parts](http://www.nationaltrailerparts.com)**. Although we will be doing a full case study in a few days, here are a few highlights we are particularly proud of.

• Smooth animations that draw your eye down the page

• Responsive design so it's easily viewed on mobile devices

• Easy-to-use navigation bar

• Effective use of white space to make the beautiful product images and various sections pop

We also relaunched a website called Stuck in the Muck for the Flaman Group of Companies. Essentially, this website is a place for farmers to post pictures of their farm equipment literally getting stuck in the muck all while taking solace in the fact that they are not alone out there. So farmers, start uploading your best messes to **[www.stuckinthemuck.com](http://www.stuckinthemuck.com)!**
