"My website doesn't appear when I search for it." This is a common problem business owners have, but there are a few things you can do to improve search engine rankings by implementing search engine optimization (SEO) on your website.

## What is SEO?

SEO is the process and implementation of strategies used to optimize your website so it can be found by search engines such as Google and Bing. Google crawls your website to see how your content matches what people are searching for by using various algorithms. Certain elements will help boost your search rankings, while other issues on your website will penalize and lower your search rankings. Google also takes into consideration how you fare against other businesses who are competing to be found for the same keywords as you.

## How Do I Improve My SEO?

When someone asks us why their website doesn't appear in a search, there are a few things we look at first:

*   The amount and type of content on the website
*   What is the user experience (UX) when on the website
*   Is the website mobile friendly
*   Are there any technical issues on the website
*   Are there pages that need to be optimized

### 1. The Amount and Type of Content

For search engines to know what your website is about, it needs content to index. Therefore, every website would benefit from a content strategy. If you have little to no content, Google won't know what your website is about. If Google doesn't know what your website contains, you won't rank when someone conducts a search.

### 2. Website User Experience

Google can tell if people are not finding what they want after clicking into your website. Your site structure should be designed in a way to help users find the information they are looking for. This includes your website's content and navigation. This is why click-bait articles can get blacklisted by search engines and even social media sites. Make sure your website's content is relevant to what people want, and make it easy for them to navigate and use your website.

### 3. Mobile Friendly Website

Google indexes and ranks websites differently depending on what people are using to conduct a search. Which means your website may appear differently in results depending on if you use a computer or a smartphone. If your website is not mobile-friendly, Google will penalize your results which will affect the amount of traffic you receive.

### 4. Technical Issues

Are things on your website broken? Do pages take a long time to load? Google doesn't want to recommend a website that doesn't work. Go through and audit your website to check for errors such as broken links, large bulky files that slow things down, features that don't work, etc.

### 5. Unoptimized Pages

There are certain things in the code and the design elements of your website that Google uses to determine what your website is about. These different elements have a different weight to them, and when you are able to optimize many aspects of your website, it adds up to really boost your results. First, check your page titles and headings, do they contain terms people are searching for? This can create the base for optimizing the rest of the content on your website.
