### <span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking for Some Chickspiration? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The local </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicken Chef</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Morris came in looking for some chicken inspired Renaissance art, and we delivered! (Haha, chicken... delivered... ok, ok fine, I'm not that funny.) The finished graphic design artwork was pretty awesome and these bad boys are sure to get attention, great for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brand marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">! (We may be kicking ourselves for not printing extra copies to hang around the office).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every company has a "thing" that makes them unique. You hear "golden arches", you think McDonald's. If you see a swoosh, you might think about Nike. Good </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brand marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> connects with people on multiple levels and gets your customers familiar with your company. Now when I see the Mona Lisa I imagine her holding a bucket of chicken from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicken Chef</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Artwork is a great way to utilize </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brand marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Keeping a consistent and unique image helps brand advocates to associate images with your brand. Think of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">brand marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like a first date. What is the first impression I want to make? What do I want them to know about me? How can we connect? Do we have similar values? Then once you've laid down that foundation for your brand, keep it consistent otherwise, customers can't get familiar with you.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand Marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is more than just your logo, it's how you tie in all of your marketing strategies. This includes your website, logo, graphic design elements, the first interaction customers have with you, social media and online interactions. </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand out from your competitors with unique artwork and a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">branding strategy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact Shayne at [info@teamgi.ca](mailto:info@teamgi.ca) to get started.</span>
