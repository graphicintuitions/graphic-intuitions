Content ' Digital Marketing Strategy
------------------------------------

Today's consumer is researched obsessed. Prior to a purchase, consumers are looking at a businesses reviews, pictures, business information, etc. Take planning a trip for example. When you plan a stay at a hotel you'll look at the hotel's website, but many people will also search for the hotel online and look at what real customers have to say on sites like TripAdvisor. They'll research things to do nearby, the distance from the airport, shopping in the area, etc, all in an attempt to make the best purchase and avoid buyers remorse.

Of course, information on these external sites can be very useful, but they can also be harmful if someone posts incorrect information or leaves a negative comment. Here are a few things you need to know about this consumer behaviour trend and what you can do in response to this trend, because if you're not providing information customers are looking for, chances are a competitor is.

Know What's Being Said About Your Business
------------------------------------------

Customers trust other customers. Regardless of if your business has an online presence, consumers have access to many online resources to see and post reviews about businesses like yours. Some of the most popular ones that relate to any business include Google My Business and social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Customers will often look to these platforms to find information, and even if you don't have accounts created Facebook and Google My Business are still able to create accounts for your business depending on popularity. So, if these platforms have incorrect information, or someone left a negative comment, it can leave an impact. Therefore, it's a good idea to create accounts on these basic platforms so that you have more control over the information being shown.

Help Customers With Their Purchase Decision
-------------------------------------------

Part of why customers do so much research when purchasing anything is to feel confident in their decision. Using this information, you can now help your customers by providing answers to their questions. To do this you can add content to your website that pertains to what customers want to know, or you can create business listings on these external sites that are relevant to your industry and contribute information. This provides your customers with helpful information as well as establishing you as an industry expert. If you're not sure what type of content to create, start by reviewing the questions you are often asked by customers.

Creating Your Content Strategy
------------------------------

For each business, the content and digital marketing strategy needed could be completely different. But ultimately customers are doing intensive research before making a purchase decision. Think about the information your customers are wanting and create a strategy for how to fulfill that need. Maybe that's through adding an online chat to your website, an informative blog, or simply adding your business hours to a Google My Business page.
