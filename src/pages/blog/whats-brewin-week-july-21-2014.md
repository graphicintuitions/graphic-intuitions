If you don't recall from last week's blog, this is our weekly post where we rate beer and talk about what we did last week (so people don't think we just have fun all day).

So let's get the important task out of the way first: what was last Friday's beer du jour? We reviewed the **_Cucumber Cream Ale from Twisted Pine's Farm to Foam series_**. From the look of the bottle and the name alone, everyone thought it sounded delicious! After the first few sips the consensus was that it was, "clean and healthy". And after a few more sips, those sentiments quickly changed to, "tastes like liquid salad" and "it's alcoholic cud juice." Mmmm.... Cud juice. Chris Reimer didn't even get past the smell, "Oh, I don't even want to taste it. It stinks like salad". We're guessing his parents had a hard time getting the veggies down his throat as a kid!

So on a cucumber rating scale out of 5, the average was about 3.5 cukes. Ultimately everyone agreed that even though it lives up to its name, they would probably only be able to drink one bottle of it and call it a day.

And now for the work part...

We are close to completing a new website design for a client that incorporates a number of animated elements while scrolling through the site. As users scroll through the page, various animations are revealed to add a level of interaction and intrigue, and to bring more attention to certain elements.  This is part of a story-telling design concept where a lot of information is provided on a single page but is revealed as you make your way down the page. It's a creative way to present information, and we think it looks pretty cool too. *Cliffhanger... We aren't revealing the site to you just yet... Check back soon.

Always with our clients' best interests in mind, we're trying out a new tool that helps us demonstrate what a client's website will look like as part of the approval process. It helps the client better visualize the design and function of their site. The tool is called [**Invision** ](http://www.invisionapp.com/)and we used it recently to show a client how the user flow on a tablet will work for their new website. It allowed them to see how things were coming along before we were ready to go live with the site. It simplifies the process on our end because changes can be made when they are still easy to do rather than making them in the programming stage which is more time consuming. It saves everyone a lot of time and is much easier on the client's pocketbook. We will have a full review of this product once we've used it a bit more.

Weekly pro tip: We often have clients ask us what quality of photos they need to provide us for print and web. Often we receive pictures that are too small to be used and the resolution is not very good. Or they are cropped in a way that makes using them difficult. Here are a few suggestions:

*   Regardless of the platform the pictures are being used for, whether print or web, it is always best to take photos in the highest resolution possible. We can always scale the picture down on our end.
*   Always zoom out a bit and leave some extra space around your subject/object in a shot so that there is room for cropping if need be.
*   Good lighting is always important when attempting to take a good picture. Use it to your advantage!
*   And, at the end of the day, if you need high quality product shots but don't want to spend the extra money, we really suggest you reconsider. Taking good quality pictures is a skill, and having pictures taken by a pro will help promote your product in the best way possible.
