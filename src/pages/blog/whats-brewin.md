We decided it would be fun to have a weekly recap post Wednesdays to see what we did in the previous week so people know how hard we really worked. It's not just all fun and games here at Graphic Intuitions, you know!

A little known fact about our team is that we seem to fancy ourselves as beer aficionados.  Well, some of us more than others. At the end of the day on Fridays, we get together over a brewed beverage to look over some of the highlights of the week (in a responsible way of course). So this week's recap post is brought to you by two brews from [Lake of the Woods Brewing Company](http://lowbrewco.com/). The first beer was the _Thumbs Up German Lager_ and the second was the _Papermaker Pilsner_. The _Thumbs up_ was a nice light beer, very refreshing and got a rating of 6 out of 10. _Papermaker Pilsner_ was described as refreshing and crisp. It scored slightly lower with 5.5 out of 10. Chris Reimer is still getting over nightmares from last week's beer, _"Total Eclipse of the Hop"_ by [Howe Sound Brewing](http://howesound.com), which barely made it onto the scoring scale.

So beers aside, here's what we were up to the week of July 14th!

One of the first things accomplished last week was the creation of a customized inventory tracking system specifically for employees to use on iPads. The key to this design is that it had to be created with a layout that worked in both portrait and landscape for optimal viewing on iPads. Tablets have rocked our world, haven't they?

We had to troubleshoot an issue with website images not showing up, and implementing CDN (Content Delivery Network) Image Delivery. Yup, pretty exciting stuff. So much so, we will have a blog post about it in the near future. Mark your calendars!

We started implementing new coding techniques: CSS with SASS and Grunt. Stay tuned for more information on this from our talented programmers.

Website troubleshooting - you've GOT to love it... Said no one ever. However, on occasions, websites get the hiccups and your friendly team at Graphic Intuitions is always ready to help figure out what kind of remedy you might need to fix the problem. One of our client's websites was not showing up for them the way it was supposed to. We quickly discovered it was an internal server issue.

**PRO TIP OF THE WEEK:** _If your website is not working in your own office, but you can view it everywhere else, it is best to call your IT crew first to see if it is an internal issue. This will hopefully save time and money for you in the future._

This concludes our first edition of "What's Brewin'"! As always, feel free to comment, ask questions and share your wisdom with us. And yes, it can be about beer too. We really don't mind.
