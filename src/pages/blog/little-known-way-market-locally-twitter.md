## The Hidden Power Of Twitter Lists

Once you configure your Recipe on IFTTT, the service will continue to monitor Twitter for your criteria. When a person tweets something that matches this criteria, they are added to your specific list. This user gets a notification about being added to your list - and this may be your 'first sales touch' with a potential customer.
