The heart of a company is its customers, so how are you keeping your customers happy and maintaining those relationships? A customer relationship management (CRM) system is so much more than a storehouse of contacts. When used properly, it builds customer relationships throughout the entire customer journey.

## Efficiencies

A CRM can essentially act as an employee, by organizing client information and automating certain things such as follow-up emails or internal tasks. A CRM can be customized to work for your business and save you and your employees time with repetitive tasks. Not only does this give you more time, but it also helps to improve the customer's experience by eliminating potential human errors.



## Sales Funnel

From awareness to sale, to retention, a CRM can be used on the sales, service, and marketing side of the business. Basically, a CRM is an essential piece in streamlining your [customer journey](http://www.stevewhittington.com/four-stages-customer-journey/) that allows your business to scale by increasing your capacity.

### Lead Generation

Do you know what message is resonating with your leads? Do you know where your leads are coming from? One benefit of organizing your customer data in a CRM is it allows you to see trends and segment your leads and clients for future targeted marketing. 



### Sales Process

So many pieces go into the sales process. 

* The automated “Thank You” email sent after a form is submitted. 
* Multiple touch points, like calls and emails, from your sales team. 
* Automated email series based on the potential customer's interests. 
* Producing and sending a quote. 
* The actual sale. 
* The follow-up. 
* The cross-sell or up-sell. 

We just listed seven possible pieces of your sales process and didn’t even touch upon the numerous tasks involved for each. There could literally be 100+ tasks from initial customer contact to sale to follow-up across multiple employees. You need to ensure no customers fall through the cracks. This means processes and reminders are needed to streamline your pipeline and create as little friction in your sales process as possible.



### Retention

> It costs 5x more to acquire a new customer than retaining an existing one. 

So what are you doing post-purchase? It should be a priority to maintain your customer relations through customer satisfaction surveys and consistent contact to stay top of mind.

Businesses are now expected to maintain a holistic customer experience that makes the buying process easy. This is hard to do if there is any disconnect between your sales, marketing, and customer support teams. By having a centralized system that can manage all of this, it greatly improves both internal and customer communications.
