## Social Media - Setting Up The Marketing Funnel

Social media is an important element of your marketing funnel - when we talk about the marketing funnel, what we mean is we want to attract people to your company via platforms like social media, and then funnel them down to your website to expose them to your products and services.

Last week we worked with one of our long-time clients on the social media strategy for her company. She already had a great start with social media with her Instagram account which works extremely well for her business because she has very visual products, but she hadn't had the time to properly set up and utilize Facebook and Twitter.

### **Determining the best platforms**

![social-media-3](/img/social-media-3.jpg)After sitting down with her, we decided she needed to bring her blog back as a way to funnel her social media audience back to her website which showcases her products and services. After evaluating her business and audience, we determined that Facebook, Twitter and Instagram were the right social media platforms for her. Our client liked that we could link her accounts together so if she only had time to post to Instagram, that post could also be sent to her Facebook and Twitter accounts. Three platforms served via one interaction.

We will be setting up her Facebook and Twitter accounts, and her blog over the next week. We are also going to provide her with a social media content strategy for the first month so she can get an idea of what types of posts might help her create better engagement, and we'll be creating her quarterly newsletter ensuring she is reaching every part of her audience.

### **Setting up for success**

Our customer understood how social media is not so much about pushing her products and services but that it's more about building a relationship with her customers, and setting herself up as an expert in her field, and then moving them through the funnel. Our goal for this client was to get her set up for success. She will mostly be handling her own accounts but may use our services on occasion if she doesn't have time to write a blog post or create content for her newsletter. With our in-house writer on staff, we can create innovative content for your blog or website with a strong call to action.

### **Helping you get inspired**

We gave our client a list of podcast links that would give her some great tips to maximize her social media efforts, and increase her sales. Our client emailed us later in the day to say that she left the meeting feeling "inspired". That's what we like to hear! Did you need some help setting up your social media strategy? Have time to post but don't know where to start? We can sit down with you to create the perfect plan, and set up your marketing funnel for success. Contact us today to set up a meeting.
