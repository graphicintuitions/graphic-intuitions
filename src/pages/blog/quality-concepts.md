When Travis Dreger from [**Quality Concepts**](http://www.qualityconcepts.ca) approached us with designing a website for their new business, we were very excited. They knew they wanted something modern and attractive, and we saw it as a great opportunity to use some of the newer dynamic styling techniques that are becoming really trendy right now. We also knew the products the company produced were high quality and would provide great visuals for the website, which really got us pumped!

There are a few specific highlights we'd like to bring your attention to. The first feature that will catch your eye when you visit the website are the animations. As you scroll down the various pages, there will be a number of dynamic elements that pop out at you to bring emphasis to certain areas. An accordion style product display on the homepage allows you to view images just by hovering over various panels, and the features animations draw the eye to some of the key benefits of their products.

Because the website is built with a custom design, we were able to really stretch our wings and get the creative juices flowing. The freedom to work within only our own limitations made this a very fun project with very few roadblocks!

All in all, this was a great project to work on and we were very happy to see it launch. Travis and his team provided a lot of valuable input into what they wanted to see in the site, while still giving us the freedom to create a design that was animated and attractive. We invite you to check out the site at [**www.qualityconcepts.ca**](http://www.qualityconcepts.ca). Do you need a new website or maybe just some refreshing?
