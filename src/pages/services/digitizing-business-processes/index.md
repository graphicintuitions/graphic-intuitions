    - image_markdown_text: The world is digital, and your business needs to be too. Keeping offline records and multiple data sources creates room for error and data loss. From a crashed computer, to internal miscommunication on a client account. Creating a central source of truth allows multiple staff to access valuable information in real-time, as they needed. No more fumbling on the phone with a customer finding the answer they need, or endless internal emails determining where information is located.

        Do you relate?
        
        - Your business uses multiple programs and software to do the same job
        
        - You have multiple sources-of-truth to manage client accounts and processes
        
        - If your business had a fire, key client account information would be lost
        
        - Time could be saved if you could automate reoccurring tasks
        
        - You have to try to combine data from multiple places to gain customer insight

        How much is your customer experience worth? The key to creating a better customer experience always comes down to understanding your customers.  
  
  
        One of the first steps to understanding your customers and the impact of your communication with your customers is to have data about your customers and your communications. When you have data in multiple places, this can be hard to gain insight and understanding because you do not have a single source of truth. The data is everywhere and it is just too hard to organize and manage.
  
  
        All this can be captured in one place.
