**April 27**\
The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, [announced](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2F458rl1jp.r.us-east-1.awstrack.me%2FL0%2Fhttps%3A%252F%252Fpm.gc.ca%252Fen%252Fnews%252Fnews-releases%252F2020%252F04%252F24%252Fprime-minister-announces-partnerships-provinces-and-territories%2F1%2F01000171bbeb4a93-719a023a-f2e0-47e6-a8fa-42c757678e96-000000%2FV-sZnhynGr1EV_HYFq0Xu7DEzuk%3D159&data=02%7C01%7Csteve.whittington%40flaman.com%7Cfb3e48f7c38443d4e94208d7eab28f55%7C5f676672a6704aaca030e1d1a7248b94%7C0%7C0%7C637235924943246394&sdata=jC93pXrkTdDXHK9g9UfaDRSrp7JTn8kG30uVcOzFtY4%3D&reserved=0) on Friday that the federal government has reached an agreement in principle with all provinces and territories to implement the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses. This program will lower rent by 75 per cent for small businesses that have been affected by COVID-19.\
The government is also providing further details on the program:

* The program will provide forgivable loans to qualifying commercial property owners to cover 50 per cent of three monthly rent payments that are payable by eligible small business tenants who are experiencing financial hardship during April, May, and June.
* The loans will be forgiven if the mortgaged property owner agrees to reduce the eligible small business tenants’ rent by at least 75 per cent for the three corresponding months under a rent forgiveness agreement, which will include a term not to evict the tenant while the agreement is in place. The small business tenant would cover the remainder, up to 25 per cent of the rent.
* Impacted small business tenants are businesses paying less than $50,000 per month in rent and who have temporarily ceased operations or have experienced at least a 70 per cent drop in pre-COVID-19 revenues. This support will also be available to non-profit and charitable organizations.

\
All claims that are approved through the CRA’s automated verification process will be sent for payment on May 5, so that payments being made through direct deposit should begin to appear in employers’ accounts as of May 7. Some applications will require a secondary verification, done manually, and in these cases the CRA may contact employers to verify information. It is expected that these secondary verifications will take no more than 72 hours in the vast majority of cases.

\
The CRA has again partnered with financial institutions to enroll Canadian employers for direct deposit, and employers can now register business payroll accounts for direct deposit with the CRA through their bank portals.

\
Signing up for direct deposit will enable employers whose applications are approved to receive their CEWS payments quickly and securely. Employers can sign up for direct deposit with their financial institutions even after applying for the CEWS.

**April 23**

*Confirmation from Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) officials occurred today with the following dates for the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS):*

* CRA portal opens for CEWS applications on April 27, 2020 (Monday)
* CRA will start processing CEWS payments on May 4, 2020 (following Monday)
* CRA anticipates that once processing starts, companies can anticipate receiving funds within days, if those companies are registered for direct deposit.

It is recommended to go to the CRA portal as soon as possible to get set up, use their calculator to estimate what your company would likely receive and, by Monday, review the Questions and Answers (Q&A) that they are in the process of putting together. The best place to start is:\

*COVID-19 Update: Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) Update*

Prime Minister Trudeau announced this morning that a calculator has been developed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to estimate what companies can expect when the CEWS comes into effect. 

The Prime Minister also indicated that applications will be accepted starting Monday, April 27, 2020 at the CRA portal that is being setup. He was, however, unable to give a timeline on availability of the funds for the CEWS. Indications are that the funds will start to flow in a week or two.

We note that the CEWS website has an update as of today and does include a calculator:

**April 16**

*COVID-19 Update: Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy Update and Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance*

The Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, [today announced new measures](https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/news-releases/2020/04/16/prime-minister-announces-additional-support-small-businesses) to support Canadian businesses so they can keep their doors open and their employees on the job.

The Government of Canada is:

Expanding the Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA) to businesses that paid between $20,000 and $1.5 million in total payroll in 2019. This new range will replace the previous one of between $50,000 and $1 million, and will help address the challenges faced by small businesses to cover non-deferrable operating costs.

Announcing its intent to introduce the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses. The program will seek to provide loans, including forgivable loans, to commercial property owners who in turn will lower or forgo the rent of small businesses for the months of April (retroactive), May, and June. Implementation of the program will require a partnership between the federal government and provincial and territorial governments, which are responsible for property owner-tenant relationships. We are working with the provinces and territories to increase rent support for businesses that are most impacted by the pandemic and we will have more details to share soon.

The government will continue to monitor and respond to the wide-ranging impacts of COVID-19, and take additional actions as needed to protect the health and safety of Canadians and stabilize the economy.

Hopefully these changes will allow more companies to take advantage of the wage subsidy, and provide for commercial rent deferral.

**April 8**

*COVID-19 Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy Update*

From the Hill Times:

According to The Globe and Mail, the feds’ draft bill for the 75 per cent wage subsidy, worth an estimated $71-billion, introduces some flexibility for businesses and charities looking to qualify. Though the requirement to demonstrate a 30 per cent revenue drop is part of the draft bill for April and May, the threshold has been reduced to 15 per cent for those looking to use March as the benchmark.

Also, according to the G&M the draft bill, will under certain conditions, allow companies to use January and February as reference periods when calculating their revenue for the subsidy.

Hopefully these changes will allow more companies to take advantage of the wage subsidy, and keep more people on their payrolls.

**April 4, 2020**

*Canada*

The [online portal to apply for the feds’ Canada Emergency Response Benefit](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) opens today. Since the government has staggered application dates by birth months, those born between January and March are first in line. While the criteria for the CERB stipulates that the beneficiary must be at least 15 years old, [some students may find themselves unable](https://globalnews.ca/news/6769986/students-concerns-cerb-qualifications/?utm_source=Subscriber+-++Hill+Times+Publishing&utm_campaign=8fa1bb0e14-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_06_08_00&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8edecd9364-8fa1bb0e14-90758901&mc_cid=8fa1bb0e14&mc_eid=7de9b89685) to qualify if they haven’t earned at least $5,000 in the past 12 months. It also excludes those who have voluntarily quit their jobs.

*Ontario*

As a temporary measure the Ontario government has revised the list of essential businesses. The updated list will direct additional businesses to close and restricts specified businesses to providing services by alternate methods such as curb side pick up and delivery, except in exceptional circumstances. This includes stores that sell hardware products, vehicle parts and supplies, pet and animal supplies, office supplies and computer products and repairs and safety supplies.

Only critical construction projects will continue, including industrial projects such as refineries and petrochemical plants and infrastructure projects such as new hospitals, roads and bridges. New starts in residential projects will stop, while residential construction that is near completion will continue. Business-owners with questions concerning their essential business status are encouraged to call the Stop the Spread hotline at 1-888-444-3659. The hotline is available from 8:30 a.m.― 9:00 p.m. Monday to Friday and 8:30 a.m.— 5:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

The updated essential businesses list can be found [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/list-essential-workplaces).

CTEA will continue to monitor and provide pertinent information for our members.

## <a id="public-health-notice"></a>Public Health Notice Regarding COVID-19

We&#39;d like to remind you that some of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of disease are

* Washing your hands regularly. Wash your hands after using the restroom, touching your face, eating, drinking, coughing, or sneezing, and at regular intervals throughout the day. Use warm soapy water and wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, or the time it takes to sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; twice. Alternatively, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is effective.
* Following proper cough and sneeze hygiene. Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue or your elbow — not your hand — and discard the tissue immediately after
* Staying at home if you are sick.
