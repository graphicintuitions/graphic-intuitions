_Canada_

The [online portal to apply for the feds’ Canada Emergency Response Benefit](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/cerb-application.html) opens today. Since the government has staggered application dates by birth months, those born between January and March are first in line. While the criteria for the CERB stipulates that the beneficiary must be at least 15 years old, [some students may find themselves unable](https://globalnews.ca/news/6769986/students-concerns-cerb-qualifications/?utm_source=Subscriber+-++Hill+Times+Publishing&utm_campaign=8fa1bb0e14-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2020_04_06_08_00&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8edecd9364-8fa1bb0e14-90758901&mc_cid=8fa1bb0e14&mc_eid=7de9b89685) to qualify if they haven’t earned at least $5,000 in the past 12 months. It also excludes those who have voluntarily quit their jobs.

_Ontario_

As a temporary measure the Ontario government has revised the list of essential businesses. The updated list will direct additional businesses to close and restricts specified businesses to providing services by alternate methods such as curb side pick up and delivery, except in exceptional circumstances. This includes stores that sell hardware products, vehicle parts and supplies, pet and animal supplies, office supplies and computer products and repairs and safety supplies.

Only critical construction projects will continue, including industrial projects such as refineries and petrochemical plants and infrastructure projects such as new hospitals, roads and bridges. New starts in residential projects will stop, while residential construction that is near completion will continue. Business-owners with questions concerning their essential business status are encouraged to call the Stop the Spread hotline at 1-888-444-3659. The hotline is available from 8:30 a.m.― 9:00 p.m. Monday to Friday and 8:30 a.m.— 5:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.

The updated essential businesses list can be found [here](https://www.ontario.ca/page/list-essential-workplaces).

_Quebec_

The updated essential services list for Quebec is [here, in French](https://www.quebec.ca/sante/problemes-de-sante/a-z/coronavirus-2019/fermeture-endroits-publics-commerces-services-covid19/), however English list has yet to be updated.

CTEA will continue to monitor and provide pertinent information for our members.

_British Columbia_

B.C.'s provincial health officer offered another glimmer of hope Saturday when she announced only 29 new test-confirmed cases, marking the smallest increase for the number of cases province wide last week.

## <a id="public-health-notice"></a>Public Health Notice Regarding COVID-19

We&#39;d like to remind you that some of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of disease are

* Washing your hands regularly. Wash your hands after using the restroom, touching your face, eating, drinking, coughing, or sneezing, and at regular intervals throughout the day. Use warm soapy water and wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, or the time it takes to sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; twice. Alternatively, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is effective.
* Following proper cough and sneeze hygiene. Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue or your elbow — not your hand — and discard the tissue immediately after
* Staying at home if you are sick.

## <a id="additional-resources"></a>Additional Resources to Consider

1. **Contact your local financial institution**. Since we know most small businesses have a relationship with their local financial institution already, we&#39;ve worked with the financial sector to increase their lending capability to support you in in this challenging time. They are a good first place to start for help.
2. **Download the [Canada Business App](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/h_07670.html)** to find tailored supports to address your needs in the face of COVID-19.
3. **Consult the Canadian Chamber of Commerce&#39;s [pandemic preparedness guide](http://www.chamber.ca/resources/pandemic-preparedness/)** to help prepare you business in the days and weeks to come.
