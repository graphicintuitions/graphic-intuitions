## <a id="public-health-notice"></a>Public Health Notice Regarding COVID-19

We&#39;d like to remind you that some of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of disease are

* Washing your hands regularly. Wash your hands after using the restroom, touching your face, eating, drinking, coughing, or sneezing, and at regular intervals throughout the day. Use warm soapy water and wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, or the time it takes to sing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; twice. Alternatively, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is effective.
* Following proper cough and sneeze hygiene. Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue or your elbow — not your hand — and discard the tissue immediately after
* Staying at home if you are sick.

If you desire additional information pertaining to Novel Coronavirus - COVID-19 – the following websites are good sources to use:

## <a id="additional-resources"></a>Additional Resources to Consider

1. **Contact your local financial institution**. Since we know most small businesses have a relationship with their local financial institution already, we&#39;ve worked with the financial sector to increase their lending capability to support you in in this challenging time. They are a good first place to start for help.
2. **Download the [Canada Business App](https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/h_07670.html)** to find tailored supports to address your needs in the face of COVID-19.
3. **Consult the Canadian Chamber of Commerce&#39;s [pandemic preparedness guide](http://www.chamber.ca/resources/pandemic-preparedness/)** to help prepare you business in the days and weeks to come.
4. **Consult the Canadian Manufacturers &amp; Exporters&#39; [Coronavirus Resource website.](https://cme-mec.ca/coronavirus-covid-19-resources/)**
